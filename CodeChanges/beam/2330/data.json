(Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [x] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is one.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache\r\n       [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**This is a work in progress, do not merge**.\r\n\r\nModified:\r\n- Use Kafka serializers and deserializers in KafkaIO\r\n- Added helper methods `fromAvro` and `toAvro`, to use serialization based on `AvroCoder`. This is uniform with other IO such as HDFS.\r\n- Moved `CoderBasedKafkaSerializer` out, and added `CoderBaseKafkaDeserializer`. These are used for `toAvro/fromAvro`, and can be useful to port existing code that relies on coder.\r\n- Added `InstantSerializer` and `InstantDeserializer`, as `Instant` is used in some of the tests.\r\n \r\nWriter lets Kafka handle serialization itself. Reader uses Kafka byte deserializers, and calls the user-provided Kafka deserializer from `advance`. Note that Kafka serializers and deserializers are not themselves `Serializable`. Hence, I've used a `Class<..>` in the `spec` both for read and write.\r\n\r\nThere is still an issue, though. `Read` still takes **both a deserializer and a coder**. This is because the source must implement `getDefaultOutputCoder`, and I am not sure how to infer it. Having to provide the two is heavy, but I am not sure how to infer the coders in this context. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\ncc @rangadi @jkff\r\n",
