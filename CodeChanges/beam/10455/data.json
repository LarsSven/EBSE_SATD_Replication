  "body": "Create a `BeamSqlUnparseContext` to cover `ZetaSQL` specific unparsing syntax.\r\n- Implement custom unparsing for `SqlTypeFamily#BINARY`\r\n  - Unparse binary string to the following format: `B'\\x01\\x62'`\r\n- Floats with a floating part equal to zero are treated as whole (`INT64`). Cast to double when that happens.\r\n- Literal strings should escape `\\` when unparsed.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
