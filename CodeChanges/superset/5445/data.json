  "body": "This issue has been plaguing me for some time, though the actual fix was somewhat trivial. FAB uses [WTForms](https://github.com/wtforms/wtforms) which regrettably coerces a `None` value into an empty string per [here](https://github.com/wtforms/wtforms/blob/3d5af963f060add8e42a99bec880321e8d2b41b3/src/wtforms/fields/core.py#L610). This means that for the database tables associated with forms string/text columns include a combination of `NULL` of empty strings (depending on how they were populated) which creates inconsistencies in the the schema, i.e., to identify non-custom SQL tables one would need to use:\r\n```\r\nCOALESCE(sql, '') = ''\r\n```\r\nas opposed to:\r\n```\r\nsql IS NULL\r\n```\r\nThis is also troublesome for uniqueness constraints as currently the following schema, table tuples would be considered different (even thought the represent the same entity): \r\n- (`NULL`, `my_table`)\r\n- (, `my_table`)\r\n\r\nThe fix is to use the [wtforms-json](https://github.com/kvesteri/wtforms-json) package which adds supports for `None` types per [here](http://wtforms-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#what-does-it-do). The package monkey patches the processing of the field and assigns the default value (`None`) when the value evaluates to [false](https://github.com/kvesteri/wtforms-json/blob/master/wtforms_json/__init__.py#L200) (which includes empty strings).\r\n\r\nThis PR also performs the necessary migration to retroactively resolve all forms which have encoded empty strings in the database.\r\n\r\nto: @betodealmeida @fabianmenges @graceguo-supercat @michellethomas @mistercrunch @timifasubaa ",
