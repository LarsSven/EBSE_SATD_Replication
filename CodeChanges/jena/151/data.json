  "body": "This is a bit of a shake-up in the HTTP machinery, but as per discussion with @afs , a \"big bang\" discarding the use of mutable HTTP clients seems like the least painful approach to move forward. Several pieces of Jena machinery are removed in this, including `HttpAuthenticator` and its impls, in favor of directly using HTTP Commons machinery to the same ends. This will cause some annoyance to folks who have used those Jena types, but I think we can reasonably mitigate that with good release docs and readiness to help on-list.\n\nThere is at least one TODO that remains here, which is to reenable the total-read-timeout for `QueryEngineHTTP`. The immutable nature of HTTP clients in the current HTTP Commons API means that it's no longer a simple matter to just pass through that timeout to HTTP machinery. I will work up a [replacement piece](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6764035/apache-httpclient-timeout) using `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` to timeout running requests, but I wanted to get this out there and let folks react to it to make sure that I'm on the right road before going any further.\n",
