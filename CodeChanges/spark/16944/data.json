  "body": "## Summary of changes\r\n\r\nAdd a new configuration option that allows Spark SQL to infer a case-sensitive schema from a Hive Metastore table's data files when a case-sensitive schema can't be read from the table properties.\r\n\r\n- Add spark.sql.hive.caseSensitiveInferenceMode param to SQLConf\r\n- Add schemaPreservesCase field to CatalogTable (set to false when schema can't\r\n  successfully be read from Hive table props)\r\n- Perform schema inference in HiveMetastoreCatalog if schemaPreservesCase is\r\n  false, depending on spark.sql.hive.caseSensitiveInferenceMode\r\n- Add alterTableSchema() method to the ExternalCatalog interface\r\n- Add HiveSchemaInferenceSuite tests\r\n- Refactor and move ParquetFileForamt.meregeMetastoreParquetSchema() as\r\n  HiveMetastoreCatalog.mergeWithMetastoreSchema\r\n- Move schema merging tests from ParquetSchemaSuite to HiveSchemaInferenceSuite\r\n\r\n[JIRA for this change](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19611)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe tests in ```HiveSchemaInferenceSuite``` should verify that schema inference is working as expected. ```ExternalCatalogSuite``` has also been extended to cover the new ```alterTableSchema()``` API.",
