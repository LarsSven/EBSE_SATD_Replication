  "body": "This PR brings arbitrary object support in UnsafeRow (both in grouping key and aggregation buffer).\n\nTwo object pools will be created to hold those non-primitive objects, and put the index of them into UnsafeRow. In order to compare the grouping key as bytes, the objects in key will be stored in a unique object pool, to make sure same objects will have same index (used as hashCode).\n\nFor StringType and BinaryType, we still put them as var-length in UnsafeRow when initializing for better performance. But for update, they will be an object inside object pools (there will be some garbages left in the buffer).\n\nBTW: Will create a JIRA once issue.apache.org is available.\n\ncc @JoshRosen @rxin \n",
