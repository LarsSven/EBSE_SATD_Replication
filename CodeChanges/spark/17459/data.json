  "body": "## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- ~~I added the method `toBlockMatrixDense` to the IndexedRowMatrix class. The current implementation of `toBlockMatrix` is insufficient for users with relatively dense IndexedRowMatrix objects, since it assumes sparsity.~~\r\n\r\nEDIT: Ended up deciding that there should be just a single `toBlockMatrix` method, which creates a BlockMatrix whose blocks may be dense or sparse depending on the sparsity of the rows. This method will work better on any current use case of `toBlockMatrix` and doesn't go through `CoordinateMatrix` like the old method. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n~~I used the same tests already written for `toBlockMatrix()` to test this method. I also added a new additional unit test for an edge case that was not adequately tested by current test suite.~~\r\n\r\nI ran the original `IndexedRowMatrix` tests, plus wrote more to better handle edge cases ignored by original tests. \r\n",
