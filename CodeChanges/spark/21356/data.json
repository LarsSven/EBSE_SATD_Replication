When there is an interrupt, the queue should be removed and stop\r\naccepting any more events.  Before this change, the queue would continue\r\nto take more events (till it was full), and then would not stop when the\r\napplication was complete because the PoisonPill couldn't be added.\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test which failed before this change.",
