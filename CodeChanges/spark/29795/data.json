  "body": "<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n1. Refactored `WithFields` Expression to make it more extensible (now `UpdateFields`). \r\n2. Added a new `dropFields` method to the `Column` class. This method should allow users to drop a `StructField` in a `StructType` column (with similar semantics to the `drop` method on `Dataset`). \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nOften Spark users have to work with deeply nested data e.g. to fix a data quality issue with an existing `StructField`. To do this with the existing Spark APIs, users have to rebuild the entire struct column. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's say you have the following deeply nested data structure which has a data quality issue (`5` is missing): \r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\n\r\nval data = spark.createDataFrame(sc.parallelize(\r\n      Seq(Row(Row(Row(1, 2, 3), Row(Row(4, null, 6), Row(7, 8, 9), Row(10, 11, 12)), Row(13, 14, 15))))),\r\n      StructType(Seq(\r\n        StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n          StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))),\r\n          StructField(\"b\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType)))), \r\n            StructField(\"c\", StructType(Seq(\r\n              StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n              StructField(\"c\", IntegerType))))\r\n          ))), \r\n          StructField(\"c\", StructType(Seq(\r\n            StructField(\"a\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"b\", IntegerType),\r\n            StructField(\"c\", IntegerType))))\r\n        )))))).cache\r\n\r\ndata.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------+                                             \r\n|a                                |\r\n+---------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4,, 6], [7, 8, 9]]]|\r\n+---------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nCurrently, to drop the missing value users would have to do something like this: \r\n```\r\nval result = data.withColumn(\"a\", \r\n  struct(\r\n    $\"a.a\", \r\n    struct(\r\n      struct(\r\n        $\"a.b.a.a\", \r\n        $\"a.b.a.c\"\r\n      ).as(\"a\"), \r\n      $\"a.b.b\", \r\n      $\"a.b.c\"\r\n    ).as(\"b\"), \r\n    $\"a.c\"\r\n  ))\r\n\r\nresult.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|a                                                              |\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], [13, 14, 15]]|\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nAs you can see above, with the existing methods users must call the `struct` function and list all fields, including fields they don't want to change. This is not ideal as: \r\n>this leads to complex, fragile code that cannot survive schema evolution. \r\n[SPARK-16483](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16483)\r\n\r\nIn contrast, with the method added in this PR, a user could simply do something like this to get the same result: \r\n```\r\nval result = data.withColumn(\"a\", 'a.dropFields(\"b.a.b\"))\r\nresult.show(false)\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|a                                                              |\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[[1, 2, 3], [[4, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]], [13, 14, 15]]|\r\n+---------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the second of maybe 3 methods that could be added to the `Column` class to make it easier to manipulate nested data. \r\nOther methods under discussion in [SPARK-22231](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22231) include `withFieldRenamed`. \r\nHowever, this should be added in a separate PR. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe documentation for `Column.withField` method has changed to include an additional note about how to write optimized queries when adding multiple nested Column directly. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests were added. Jenkins must pass them. \r\n\r\n### Related JIRAs: \r\nMore discussion on this topic can be found here: \r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22231\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16483\r\n",
