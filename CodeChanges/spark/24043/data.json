  "body": "## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, ORC's `inferSchema` is implemented as randomly choosing one ORC file and reading its schema. \r\n\r\nThis PR follows the behavior of Parquet, it implements merge schemas logic by reading all ORC files in parallel through a spark job. \r\n\r\nUsers can enable merge schema by `spark.read.orc(\"xxx\").option(\"mergeSchema\", \"true\")` or by setting `spark.sql.orc.mergeSchema` to `true`, the prior one has higher priority.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\ntested by UT OrcUtilsSuite.scala",
