  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to replace `%` by `Math.floorMod` in `DateTimeUtils.truncTimestamp` for the `HOUR` and `DAY` levels.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the issue of incorrect truncation of timestamps before the epoch `1970-01-01T00:00:00.000000Z` to the `HOUR` and `DAY` levels. For example, timestamps after the epoch are truncated by cutting off the rest part of the timestamp:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('HOUR', '2020-02-11 00:01:02.123'), date_trunc('HOUR', '2020-02-11 00:01:02.789');\r\n2020-02-11 00:00:00\t2020-02-11 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nbut hours in the truncated timestamp before the epoch are increased by 1:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('HOUR', '1960-02-11 00:01:02.123'), date_trunc('HOUR', '1960-02-11 00:01:02.789');\r\n1960-02-11 01:00:00\t1960-02-11 01:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above outputs correct result:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select date_trunc('HOUR', '1960-02-11 00:01:02.123');\r\n1960-02-11 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new tests to `DateFunctionsSuite`.",
