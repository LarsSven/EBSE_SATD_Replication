  "body": "## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently in the grammar file, we have the joinType rule defined as following : \r\n```\r\njoinType\r\n    : INNER?\r\n   ....\r\n   ....\r\n    | LEFT SEMI\r\n    | LEFT? ANTI\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\nThe keyword LEFT is optional for ANTI join even though its not optional for SEMI join. When\r\nusing data frame interface join type \"anti\" is not allowed. The allowed types are \"left_anti\" or \r\n\"leftanti\" for anti joins. ~~In this PR, i am making the LEFT keyword mandatory for ANTI joins so \r\nit aligns better with the LEFT SEMI join in the grammar file and also the join types allowed from dataframe api.~~\r\n\r\nThis PR makes LEFT optional for SEMI join in .g4 and add \"semi\" and \"anti\" join types from dataframe. \r\n\r\n~~I have not opened any JIRA for this as probably we may need some discussion to see if\r\nwe are going to address this or not.~~\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nModified the join type tests.",
