  "body": "https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-732\n\nIn current implementation, the accumulator will be updated for every successfully finished task, even the task is from a resubmitted stage, which makes the accumulator counter-intuitive\n\nIn this patch, I changed the way for the DAGScheduler to update the accumulator, \n\nDAGScheduler maintains a HashTable, mapping the stage id to the received <accumulator_id , value> pairs. Only when the stage becomes independent, (no job needs it any more), we accumulate the values of the <accumulator_id , value>  pairs, when a task finished, we check if the HashTable has contained such stageId, it saves the accumulator_id, value only when the task is the first finished task of a new stage or the stage is running for the first attempt...\n\n---\n\nHowever, the existence of the duplicate update is also related to the cache, especially when we make some accumulator operation in the transformation....(the original JIRA also discussed this)\n\ne.g. \n\n```\nval a = sc.parallelize(List(1, 2, 3, 4))\nval b = a.map(i => {accum += 1; i + 1})\nval c = b.filter(i => i < 4)\nc.count() - accum is 4\nc.count() - accum is 8\nc.cache()\nc.count() - accum is still 8\n```\n\nSo for the user, the uncontrollable cache behaviour also affects the final result of the accumulator presented to the user when they put the accumulator operation in a transformation...\n\nMy question here is whether we should ensure the accumulator += operation is executed for only once in transformation level, or we can assume that the user should be aware of the possible duplicate update...\n\nGlad to hear your advice\n",
