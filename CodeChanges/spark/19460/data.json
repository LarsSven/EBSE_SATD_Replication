  "body": "## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe should not break the assumption that the length of the allocated byte array is word rounded:  \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/UnsafeRow.java#L170\r\nSo we want to use `Integer.MAX_VALUE - 15` instead of `Integer.MAX_VALUE - 8` as the upper bound of an allocated byte array. \r\n\r\ncc: @srowen @gatorsmile \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSince the Spark unit test JVM has less than 1GB heap, here we run the test code as a submit job, so it can run on a JVM has 4GB memory. \r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n",
