  "body": "This is a follow up to 9aadcffabd226557174f3ff566927f873c71672e that extends Spark SQL to allow users to _repeatedly_ optimize and execute structured queries.  A `ContinuousQuery` can be expressed using SQL, DataFrames or Datasets.  The purpose of this PR is only to add some initial infrastructure which will be extended in subsequent PRs.\n## User-facing API\n- `sqlContext.streamFrom` and `df.streamTo` return builder objects that are analogous to the `read/write` interfaces already available to executing queries in a batch-oriented fashion.\n- `ContinuousQuery` provides an interface for interacting with a query that is currently executing in the background.\n## Internal Interfaces\n- `StreamExecution` - executes streaming queries in micro-batches\n\nThe following are currently internal, but public APIs will be provided in a future release.\n- `Source` - an interface for providers of continually arriving data.  A source must have a notion of an `Offset` that monotonically tracks what data has arrived.  For fault tolerance, a source must be able to replay data given a start offset.\n- `Sink` - an interface that accepts the results of a continuously executing query.  Also responsible for tracking the offset that should be resumed from in the case of a failure.\n## Testing\n- `MemoryStream` and `MemorySink` - simple implementations of source and sink that keep all data in memory and have methods for simulating durability failures\n- `StreamTest` - a framework for performing actions and checking invariants on a continuous query\n",
