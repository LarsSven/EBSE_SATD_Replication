  "body": "In order to enable truncate for PostgreSQL databases in Spark JDBC, a change is needed to the query used for truncating a PostgreSQL table. By default, PostgreSQL will automatically truncate any descendant tables if a TRUNCATE query is executed. As this may result in (unwanted) side-effects, the query used for the truncate should be specified separately for PostgreSQL, specifying only to TRUNCATE a single table.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd `getTruncateQuery` function to `JdbcDialect.scala`, with default query. Overridden this function for PostgreSQL to only truncate a single table. Also sets `isCascadingTruncateTable` to false, as this will allow truncates for PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests all pass. Added test for `getTruncateQuery`\r\n",
