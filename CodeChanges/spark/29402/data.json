  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to `include` `_images` and `_sources` directories, generated from Sphinx, in Jekyll build.\r\n\r\n**For `_images` directory,**\r\nAfter SPARK-31851, now we add some images to use within the pages built by Sphinx. It copies and images into `_images` directory. Later, when Jekyll builds, the underscore directories are ignored by default which ends up with missing image in the main doc.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-08-11 at 1 52 46 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/89859104-2e571080-dbdb-11ea-817c-c04bbcd4088e.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-08-11 at 1 49 00 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/89859105-30b96a80-dbdb-11ea-85c6-8a135eddf613.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**For `_sources` directory,**\r\nPlease refer [here](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/sphinx-pretty-searchresults#source-links) and [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-html_copy_source). They are generated by default and used by default in the documentations by Sphinx, and we should better include them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo show the images correctly in PySpark documentation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, only in unreleased branches.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nSKIP_SCALADOC=1 SKIP_RDOC=1 SKIP_SQLDOC=1 jekyll serve --watch\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
