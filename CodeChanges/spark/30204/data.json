  "body": "\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis adds support for Stage level scheduling to kubernetes. Kubernetes can support dynamic allocation via the shuffle tracking option which means we can support stage level scheduling by getting new executors.  \r\nThe main changes here are having the k8s cluster manager pass the resource profile id into the executors and then the ExecutorsPodsAllocator has to request executors based on the individual resource profiles.  I tried to keep code changes here to a minimum. I specifically choose to leave the ExecutorPodsSnapshot the way it was and construct the resource profile to pod states on the fly, with a fast path when not using other resource profiles, to keep the impact to a minimum.  This results in the main changes required are just wrapping the allocation logic in a for loop over each profile.  The other main change is in the basic feature step we have to look at the resources in the ResourceProfile to request pods with the correct resources.  Much of the other logic like in the executor life cycle manager doesn't need to be resource profile.\r\n\r\nThis also adds support for [SPARK-32661]Spark executors on K8S should request extra memory for off-heap allocations because the stage level scheduling api has support for this and it made sense to make consistent with YARN.  This was started with PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29477 but never updated so I just did it here.   To do this I moved a few functions around that were now used by both YARN and kubernetes so you will see some changes in Utils.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAdd the feature to Kubernetes based on customer feedback.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes the feature now works with K8s, but not underlying API changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nTested manually on kubernetes cluster and with unit tests.",
