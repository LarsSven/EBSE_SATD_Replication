  "body": "This is the next iteration of @tnachen's previous PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/4027\n\nIn that PR, we resolved with @andrewor14 and @pwendell to implement the Mesos scheduler's support of `spark.executor.cores` to be consistent with YARN and Standalone.  This PR implements that resolution.\n\nThis PR implements two high-level features.  These two features are co-dependent, so they're implemented both here:\n- Mesos support for spark.executor.cores\n- Multiple executors per slave\n\nWe at Mesosphere have been working with Typesafe on a Spark/Mesos integration test suite: https://github.com/typesafehub/mesos-spark-integration-tests, which passes for this PR.\n\nThe contribution is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source license. \n",
