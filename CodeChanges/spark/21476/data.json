  "body": "Because the way YARN executes commands via bash -c, everything needs\r\nto be quoted so that the whole command is fully contained inside a\r\nbash string and is interpreted correctly when the string is read by\r\nbash. This is a bit different than the quoting done when executing\r\nthings as if typing in a bash shell.\r\n\r\nTweaked unit tests to exercise the bad behavior, which would cause\r\nexisting tests to time out without the fix. Also tested on a real\r\ncluster, verifying the shell script created by YARN to run the\r\ncontainer.\r\n",
