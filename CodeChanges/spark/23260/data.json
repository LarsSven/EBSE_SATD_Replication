  "body": "## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes adding a new configuration on SHS: custom executor log URL pattern. This will enable end users to replace executor logs to other than RM provide, like external log service, which enables to serve executor logs when NodeManager becomes unavailable in case of YARN.\r\n\r\nEnd users can build their own of custom executor log URLs with pre-defined patterns which would be vary on each resource manager. This patch adds some patterns to YARN resource manager. (For others, there's even no executor log url available so cannot define patterns as well.)\r\n\r\nPlease refer the doc change as well as added UTs in this patch to see how to set up the feature.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT, as well as manual test with YARN cluster",
