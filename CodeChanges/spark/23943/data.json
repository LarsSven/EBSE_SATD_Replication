This proposes to support nested schema pruning for ORC too.\r\n\r\nNote: This only covers ORC v1. For ORC v2, the necessary change is at the schema pruning rule. We should deal with ORC v2 as a TODO item, in order to reduce review burden.\r\n                                                                                                                \r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n",
