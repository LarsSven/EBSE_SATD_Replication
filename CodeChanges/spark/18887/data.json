  "body": "The application listing is still generated from event logs, but is now stored\r\nin a KVStore instance. By default an in-memory store is used, but a new config\r\nallows setting a local disk path to store the data, in which case a LevelDB\r\nstore will be created.\r\n\r\nThe provider stores things internally using the public REST API types; I believe\r\nthis is better going forward since it will make it easier to get rid of the\r\ninternal history server API which is mostly redundant at this point.\r\n\r\nI also added a finalizer to LevelDBIterator, to make sure that resources are\r\neventually released. This helps when code iterates but does not exhaust the\r\niterator, thus not triggering the auto-close code.\r\n\r\nHistoryServerSuite was modified to not re-start the history server unnecessarily;\r\nthis makes the json validation tests run more quickly.",
