  "body": "This change exposes the application ID generated by the Spark Master, Mesos or Yarn\nvia the SparkListenerApplicationStart event. It then uses that information to expose the\napplication via its ID in the history server, instead of using the internal directory name\ngenerated by the event logger as an application id. This allows someone who knows\nthe application ID to easily figure out the URL for the application's entry in the HS, aside\nfrom looking better.\n\nIn Yarn mode, this is used to generate a direct link from the RM application list to the\nSpark history server entry (thus providing a fix for SPARK-2150).\n\nNote this sort of assumes that the different managers will generate app ids that are\nsufficiently different from each other that clashes will not occur.\n",
