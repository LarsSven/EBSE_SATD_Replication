  "body": "## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR accomplishes the following two items.\r\n\r\n1. Reduce # of global variables from two to one for generated code of `Case` and `Coalesce` and remove global variables for generated code of `In`.\r\n2. Make lifetime of global variable local within an operation\r\n  \r\nItem 1. reduces # of constant pool entries in a Java class. Item 2. ensures that an variable is not passed to arguments in a method split by `CodegenContext.splitExpressions()`, which is addressed by #19865.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests into `PredicateSuite`, `NullExpressionsSuite`, and `ConditionalExpressionSuite`.",
