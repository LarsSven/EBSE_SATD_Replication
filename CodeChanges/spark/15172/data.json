  "body": "## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDIGEST-MD5 mechanism is used for SASL authentication and secure communication. DIGEST-MD5 mechanism supports 3DES, DES, and RC4 ciphers. However, 3DES, DES and RC4 are slow relatively.\n\nAES provide better performance and security by design and is a replacement for 3DES according to NIST. Apache Common Crypto is a cryptographic library optimized with AES-NI, this patch employ Apache Common Crypto as enc/dec backend for SASL authentication and secure channel to improve spark RPC.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests and Integration test.\n",
