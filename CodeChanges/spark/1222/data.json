  "body": "Currently the event logger uses a directory and several files to\ndescribe an app's event log, all but one of which are empty. This\nis not very HDFS-friendly, since creating lots of nodes in HDFS\n(especially when they don't contain any data) is frowned upon due\nto the node metadata being kept in the NameNode's memory.\n\nInstead, add a header section to the event log file that contains metadata\nneeded to read the events. This metadata includes things like the Spark\nversion (for future code that may need it for backwards compatibility) and\nthe compression codec used for the event data.\n\nWith the new approach, aside from reducing the load on the NN, there's\nalso a lot less remote calls needed when reading the log directory.\n",
