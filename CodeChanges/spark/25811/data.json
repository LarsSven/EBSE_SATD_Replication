  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes adding new feature to KVStore, snapshot (dump) & restore. The structure of snapshot file is also described to the design doc, but it's alike the structure of delta/snapshot file in HDFSBackedStateStoreProvider.\r\n\r\nHere's the format of snapshot file. The file is in binary format, and follows the way how DataOutputStream writes the types of \u201cint\u201d and \u201cbyte[]\u201d, hence it follows \u201cbig-endian\u201d when writing \u201cint\u201d type of value.\r\n\r\n* write(int) : https://github.com/jdk-mirror/openjdk8/blob/d15d915ceb0f6a5bfab067a23a9e4a674dac3da8/java/io/DataOutputStream.java#L187-L202\r\n* write(byte[]) : https://github.com/jdk-mirror/openjdk8/blob/master/java/io/FilterOutputStream.java#L80-L127\r\n\r\nThe file will start with metadata information, as KVStore has at most one metadata object being stored.\r\n\r\n> the length of metadata class name (int) | metadata class name (byte[]) | the length of serialized metadata object (int) | serialized metadata object (byte[]) | -2 (int)\r\n\r\nIf there's no metadata stored in KVStore, the length of metadata class name would be -2, which denotes following fields will not be presented.\r\n\r\nAnd the file will contain normal objects for each type which format is below:\r\n\r\n> the length of class name (int) | class name (byte[]) | the length of `#1` serialized object (int) | `#1` serialized object (byte[]) | ... (`#2`, `#3`, ...) | -2 (int)\r\n\r\nAbove format will be repeated for each type, and when no object is left for dumping, we simply put -1 in the place where the length of class name is expected to mark the end of file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe new feature will be used as a building block for [SPARK-28870](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-28870). The patch is intended to be separate with the issue, as I would like to make each PR smaller.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, as KVStore interface is defined as `@Private`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new UTs.",
