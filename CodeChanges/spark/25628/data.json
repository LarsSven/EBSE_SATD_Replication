  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n**Root Cause:**\r\nWhen a dataframe is created using select statement (using **spark.sql.parser.quotedRegexColumnNames=true**) dataframe fill is called- the _fillCol_ in DataFrameNaFunctions, **``(backtick)** are added  explicitly to the **columnNames**, the column name is misunderstood to be a regex and it is set as an unresolvedregex, which makes the coalesce resolving to fail.\r\n\r\n_Observation_\r\nWhen we create the dataframe from the select statement using a regex, valid columns names are returned after applying the filter(regex). So adding _backticks_ to column name in this flow was not needed. To check the impact, select statement with regex were used, there was no impact while executing without the _backticks_.\r\n\r\n**After Fix**\r\nWhile passing the columnname to the dataframe column method, **``(backtick)** are not added, as the value that is received is not a regular expression, but a valid column name.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBy doing this change column name is not considered as regex and the proper Column function is derived.\r\nAnd does not fail to resolve the expression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe patch was tested by adding UT cases. And testing in spark shell using various select statement .(with and without regex)\r\n\r\nBefore Fix:\r\n![Before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51401130/63996784-417fe600-cb1a-11e9-9c0c-f15a0e9d362c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Fix:\r\n![After](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51401130/63996792-4e043e80-cb1a-11e9-8ddf-753f9e1444f8.png)\r\n\r\n",
