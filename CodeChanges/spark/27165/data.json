So, `pandas_udf` is now consistent with regular `udf`s and other expressions.\r\n\r\n    `df.mapInPandas(udf)`  -replace-> `df.mapInPandas(f, schema)`\r\n    `df.groupby.apply(udf)`  -alias-> `df.groupby.applyInPandas(f, schema)`\r\n    `df.groupby.cogroup.apply(udf)`  -replace-> `df.groupby.cogroup.applyInPandas(f, schema)`\r\n\r\n    *`df.groupby.apply` was added from 2.3 while the other were added in the master only.\r\n\r\n- No deprecation for the existing ways for now.\r\n    ```python\r\n    @pandas_udf(schema='...', functionType=PandasUDFType.SCALAR)\r\n    def func(c1, c2):\r\n        pass\r\n    ```\r\nIf users are happy with this, I plan to deprecate the existing way and declare using type hints is not experimental anymore.\r\n\r\nOne design goal in this PR was that, avoid touching the internal (since we didn't deprecate the old ways for now), but supports type hints with a minimised changes only at the interface.\r\n\r\n- Once we deprecate or remove the old ways, I think it requires another refactoring for the internal in the future. At the very least, we should rename internal pandas evaluation types.\r\n- If users find this experimental type hints isn't quite helpful, we should simply revert the changes at the interface level.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to address old design issues. Please see [the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-kV0FS_LF2zvaRh_GhkV32Uqksm_Sq8SvnBBmRyxm30/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nFor behaviour changes, No.\r\n\r\nIt adds new ways to use pandas UDFs by using type hints. See below.\r\n\r\n**SCALAR**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@pandas_udf(schema='...')\r\ndef func(c1: Series, c2: DataFrame) -> Series:\r\n    pass  # DataFrame represents a struct column\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SCALAR_ITER**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@pandas_udf(schema='...')\r\ndef func(iter: Iterator[Tuple[Series, DataFrame, ...]]) -> Iterator[Series]:\r\n    pass  # Same as SCALAR but wrapped by Iterator\r\n```\r\n\r\n**GROUPED_AGG**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@pandas_udf(schema='...')\r\ndef func(c1: Series, c2: DataFrame) -> int:\r\n    pass  # DataFrame represents a struct column\r\n```\r\n\r\n**GROUPED_MAP**:\r\n\r\nThis was added in Spark 2.3 as of SPARK-20396. As described above, it keeps the existing behaviour. Additionally, we now have a new alias `groupby.applyInPandas` for `groupby.apply`. See the example below:\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef func(pdf):\r\n    return pdf\r\n\r\ndf.groupby(\"...\").applyInPandas(func, schema=df.schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**MAP_ITER**: this is not a pandas UDF anymore\r\n\r\nThis was added in Spark 3.0 as of SPARK-28198; and this PR replaces the usages. See the example below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef func(iter):\r\n    for df in iter:\r\n        yield df\r\n\r\ndf.mapInPandas(func, df.schema)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**COGROUPED_MAP**: this is not a pandas UDF anymore\r\n\r\nThis was added in Spark 3.0 as of SPARK-27463; and this PR replaces the usages. See the example below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef asof_join(left, right):\r\n    return pd.merge_asof(left, right, on=\"...\", by=\"...\")\r\n\r\n df1.groupby(\"...\").cogroup(df2.groupby(\"...\")).applyInPandas(asof_join, schema=\"...\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests added and tested against Python 2.7, 3.6 and 3.7.\r\n",
