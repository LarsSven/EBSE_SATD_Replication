  "body": "## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDo continuous processing writes with multiple compute() calls.\r\n\r\nThe current strategy (before this PR) is hacky; we just call next() on an iterator which has already returned hasNext = false, knowing that all the nodes we whitelist handle this properly. This will have to be changed before we can support more complex query plans. (In particular, I have a WIP https://github.com/jose-torres/spark/pull/13 which should be able to support aggregates in a single partition with minimal additional work.)\r\n\r\nMost of the changes here are just refactoring to accommodate the new model. The behavioral changes are:\r\n\r\n* The writer now calls prev.compute(split, context) once per epoch within the epoch loop.\r\n* ContinuousDataSourceRDD now spawns a ContinuousQueuedDataReader which is shared across multiple calls to compute() for the same partition.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting unit tests",
