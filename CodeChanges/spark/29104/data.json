  "body": "### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNormally, a Null aware anti join will be planed into BroadcastNestedLoopJoin which is very time consuming, for instance, in TPCH Query 16.\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect\r\n    p_brand,\r\n    p_type,\r\n    p_size,\r\n    count(distinct ps_suppkey) as supplier_cnt\r\nfrom\r\n    partsupp,\r\n    part\r\nwhere\r\n    p_partkey = ps_partkey\r\n    and p_brand <> 'Brand#45'\r\n    and p_type not like 'MEDIUM POLISHED%'\r\n    and p_size in (49, 14, 23, 45, 19, 3, 36, 9)\r\n    and ps_suppkey not in (\r\n        select\r\n            s_suppkey\r\n        from\r\n            supplier\r\n        where\r\n            s_comment like '%Customer%Complaints%'\r\n    )\r\ngroup by\r\n    p_brand,\r\n    p_type,\r\n    p_size\r\norder by\r\n    supplier_cnt desc,\r\n    p_brand,\r\n    p_type,\r\n    p_size\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn above query, will planed into\r\n\r\nLeftAnti\r\n    condition Or((ps_suppkey=s_suppkey), IsNull(ps_suppkey=s_suppkey))\r\n\r\nInside BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec will perform O(M\\*N), BUT if there is only single column in NAAJ, we can always change buildSide into a HashSet, and streamedSide just need to lookup in the HashSet, then the calculation will be optimized into O(M).\r\n\r\nBut this optimize is only targeting on null aware anti join with single column case, because multi-column support is much more complicated, we might be able to support multi-column in future.\r\nAfter apply this patch, the TPCH Query 16 performance decrease from 41mins to 30s\r\n\r\nThe semantic of null-aware anti join is:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17242071/88077041-66a39a00-cbad-11ea-8fb6-c235c4d219b4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTPCH is a common benchmark for distributed compute engine, all other 21 Query works fine on Spark, except for Query 16, apply this patch will make Spark more competitive among all these popular engine. BTW, this patch has restricted rules and only apply on NAAJ Single Column case, which is safe enough.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. SQLQueryTestSuite with NOT IN keyword SQL, add CONFIG_DIM with spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin on and off\r\n2. added case in org.apache.spark.sql.JoinSuite.\r\n3. added case in org.apache.spark.sql.SubquerySuite.\r\n3. Compare performance before and after applying this patch against TPCH Query 16.\r\n4. config combination against e2e test with following\r\n\r\n```\r\nMap(\r\n  \"spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\" -> \"false\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\" -> \"false\"\r\n),\r\nMap(\r\n  \"sspark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\" -> \"false\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\" -> \"true\"\r\n),\r\nMap(\r\n  \"spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\" -> \"false\"\r\n),\r\nMap(\r\n  \"spark.sql.optimizeNullAwareAntiJoin\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.adaptive.enabled\" -> \"true\",\r\n  \"spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage\" -> \"true\"\r\n)\r\n```",
