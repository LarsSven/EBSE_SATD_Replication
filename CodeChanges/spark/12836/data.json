  "body": "## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\ngapply() applies an R function on groups grouped by one or more columns of a DataFrame, and returns a DataFrame. It is like GroupedDataSet.flatMapGroups() in the Dataset API.\n\nPlease, let me know what do you think and if you have any ideas to improve it.\n\nThank you!\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests.\n1. Primitive test with different column types\n2. Add a boolean column\n3. Compute average by a group\n",
