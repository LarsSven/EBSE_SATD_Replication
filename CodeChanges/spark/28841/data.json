  "body": "<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nTwo new options, _modifiiedBefore_  and _modifiedAfter_, is provided expecting a value in 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss' format.  _PartioningAwareFileIndex_ considers these options during the process of checking for files, just before considering applied _PathFilters_ such as `pathGlobFilter.`  In order to filter file results, a new PathFilter class was derived for this purpose.  General house-keeping around classes extending PathFilter was performed for neatness.  It became apparent support was needed to handle multiple potential path filters.  Logic was introduced for this purpose and the associated tests written.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWhen loading files from a data source, there can often times be thousands of file within a respective file path.  In many cases I've seen, we want to start loading from a folder path and ideally be able to begin loading files having modification dates past a certain point.  This would mean out of thousands of potential files, only the ones with modification dates greater than the specified timestamp would be considered.  This saves a ton of time automatically and reduces significant complexity managing this in code.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduces an option that can be used with batch-based Spark file data sources.  A documentation update was made to reflect an example and usage of the new data source option.\r\n\r\n**Example Usages**  \r\n_Load all CSV files modified after date:_ \r\n`spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"modifiedAfter\",\"2020-06-15T05:00:00\").load()`\r\n\r\n_Load all CSV files modified before date:_\r\n`spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"modifiedBefore\",\"2020-06-15T05:00:00\").load()`  \r\n\r\n_Load all CSV files modified between two dates:_ \r\n`spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"modifiedAfter\",\"2019-01-15T05:00:00\").option(\"modifiedBefore\",\"2020-06-15T05:00:00\").load()  \r\n`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nA handful of unit tests were added to support the positive, negative, and edge case code paths. It's also live in a handful of our Databricks dev environments.  ",
