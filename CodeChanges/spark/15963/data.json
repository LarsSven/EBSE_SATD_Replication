  "body": "## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCostFun used to send a dense vector of zeroes as a closure in a\r\ntreeAggregate call. To avoid that, we replace treeAggregate by\r\nmapPartition + treeReduce, creating a zero vector inside the mapPartition\r\nblock in-place.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test for module mllib run locally for correctness.\r\n\r\nAs for performance we run an heavy optimization on our production data (50 iterations on 128 MB weight vectors) and have seen significant decrease in terms both of runtime and container being killed by lack of off-heap memory.\r\n",
