  "body": "#4490 does not cover all the cases. While performing end-to-end tests with this snapshot, I found that traces were still not aggregating correctly. This PR fixes the problem.\r\nI am not sure why the tests did not catch this issue, so unfortunately cannot provide better automatic coverage.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] If you're unsure, you can format the pull request title like `[CAMEL-XXX] Fixes bug in camel-file component`, where you replace `CAMEL-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -Psourcecheck` in your module with source check enabled to make sure basic checks pass and there are no checkstyle violations. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\nBelow are the contribution guidelines:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/camel/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md",
