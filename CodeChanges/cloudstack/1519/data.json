  "body": "This PR addresses CLOUDSTACK-9339 and may need a code review from someone familiar with the System VM scripts. In particular, this PR has not been tested in a VPC RvR context. Only standalone routers and RvR routers have been demonstrated.\n- **d582358: Leave public interfaces down in backup redundant routers.** Previously backup routers were bringing all interfaces up and thus arping public IPs away from the master router.\n- **9ee1eb6: Add the default gateway to the main routing table when interfaces are configured.** The gateway for the first public IP was always being added to the main routing table. Sometimes a router would consequently add the gateway for an IP other than the default source-NAT IP. This would prevent outbound connectivity for guest VMs.\n- **ad9d72f: Add default gateway to device-specific routing tables.** Link-level routes were being put into the device-specific routing tables (accessed via firewall marks) but these are unnecessary. Instead, the default gateway is needed to allow the kernel to make an appropriate routing decision.\n- **8db879e: Only mark guest connections when they are part of a static-NAT.** Guest connections were being marked with a zero. This added no functionality and prevented static-NAT rules from routing outbound traffic properly as device-specific routing tables would not be used. Instead, all traffic would be routed out via the default public interface.\n- **788b1be: Allow forwarding and collect network stats on any public interface.** Forwarding rules and network stats were limited to eth2 on RvR networks. This needed to be decoupled from eth2 and reapplied to whichever interface was under consideration.\n- **b19e8aa: Ensure that CONNMARK --restore-mark only appears once.** This is a bit of a hack and can do with being improved. The CONNMARK rule was not being picked up by the de-duplication logic in CsNetfilter and was being added twice. This caused checksum errors on packets traversing NAT.\n- **bf285e1: Transition to master state should add all necessary routes.** Now that backup routers keep their interfaces down, the route logic executed at configuration-time cannot be applied. Instead, once the interface is brought up during a transition to master, routers must re-evaluate what routes are needed and add them. Unfortunately I couldn't see a way to re-use the existing route logic with the variables that I had in scope so there is some duplication. In some cases, routers did not successfully arp IPs away from the old master so some arp logic was added. During a failover most connections with guest VMs will be maintained with only minor packet loss. SSH sessions implemented via port-forwarding rules on an interface other than the source-NAT interface consistently get dropped, however, so the failover isn't quite seamless. It's possible that there's an easy fix for that.\n\nI expect that a number of tests may need to be modified/written as part of this PR. Any feedback or pointers would be useful as initially I'll be relying on the CI failures to tell me where to look.\n",
