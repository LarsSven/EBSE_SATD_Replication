  "body": "This PR makes several changes to the task context variables. I realise these are multiple changes, if you'd like me to split the PR into individual PRs, let me know.\r\n\r\n- Sorted the context variables alphabetically, both in the code & in the docs.\r\n- I think it's useful to pass a number of variables from which users can compute derived values, however wouldn't pass _and_ the \"main\" variables _and_ the derived variables. I'd leave deriving values from such \"main\" variables up to the user. Otherwise, we could start adding ds_nextweek, ds_nextmonth, ds_nextyear, etc. which I consider a task for the user. Hence, I removed such \"derived\" values:\r\n\r\n  - Removed `yesterday_ds`, `yesterday_ds_nodash`, `tomorrow_ds`, `tomorrow_ds_nodash`. IMO the `next_*` and `previous_*` variables are useful since these require complex logic to compute the next execution date, however would leave these variables up to the user since they are simple one-liners and don't relate to the DAG interval.\r\n  - Removed `tables`. This is a field in `params`, and is thus also accessible by the user (`{{ params.tables }}`). Also, it was undocumented.\r\n  - Removed `latest_date`. It's the same as `ds` and was also undocumented.\r\n  - Removed `inlets` and `outlets`. Also undocumented, and have the inlets/outlets ever worked/ever been used by anybody?\r\n  - Removed `end_date` and `END_DATE`. Both have the same value, so it doesn't make sense to have both variables. Also, the value is `ds` which contains the start date of the interval, so the naming didn't make sense to me. However, if anybody argues in favour of adding \"start_date\" and \"end_date\" to provide the start and end datetime of task instance intervals, I'd be happy to add them.\r\n- Grouped together statements computing similar variables (e.g. the statements building the `ds_*` variables are now grouped together)\r\n\r\n_Sidenote: in principle the `ds*` and `ts*` variables are also derivations from the `execution_date`, however these are widely used and I also consider them useful._\r\n\r\nThe remaining context variables are now:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    'conf': configuration,\r\n    'dag': task.dag,\r\n    'dag_run': dag_run,\r\n    'ds': ds,\r\n    'ds_nodash': ds_nodash,\r\n    'execution_date': self.execution_date,\r\n    'macros': macros,\r\n    'next_ds': next_ds,\r\n    'next_ds_nodash': next_ds_nodash,\r\n    'next_execution_date': next_execution_date,\r\n    'params': params,\r\n    'prev_ds': prev_ds,\r\n    'prev_ds_nodash': prev_ds_nodash,\r\n    'prev_execution_date': prev_execution_date,\r\n    'run_id': run_id,\r\n    'task': task,\r\n    'task_instance': self,\r\n    'task_instance_key_str': ti_key_str,\r\n    'test_mode': self.test_mode,\r\n    'ti': self,\r\n    'ts': ts,\r\n    'ts_nodash': ts_nodash,\r\n    'ts_nodash_with_tz': ts_nodash_with_tz,\r\n    'var': {\r\n        'json': VariableJsonAccessor(),\r\n        'value': VariableAccessor(),\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4192\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nOnly altered tests, no additions.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n",
