  "body": "Make sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5241\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n  - In case you are proposing a fundamental code change, you need to create an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)).\r\n  - In case you are adding a dependency, check if the license complies with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nI believe there are many ways to improve the current test suite. To start, I suggest to make the test class naming consistent by always starting with \"Test\".\r\n\r\nSome insights:\r\n- There are 557 test classes (`grep -r \"class\" . | grep \"TestCase\" | wc -l`)\r\n- 240 of those start with \"Test\"\r\n- 277 of those end with \"Test\"\r\n- Leaving 40 classes with some other name, e.g. CliTests, PluginsTestRBAC and DagGcpSystemTestCase\r\n\r\nThere is no convention AFAIK in unittest for test classes (only tests themselves -> start with \"test\"). I suggest to make all test classes start with \"Test\" because I know there is some work being done on moving to Pytest, which discovers test classes starting with \"Test\" ([link](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/goodpractices.html#conventions-for-python-test-discovery)).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis PR involved renaming all non Test* named test classes.\r\n\r\nI had to make one other change in tests/utils/test_helpers.py which contained two classes TestHelpers and HelpersTest, both testing exactly the same things, even with identical test names. I merged the two classes and merged the tests with identical names.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n  - If you implement backwards incompatible changes, please leave a note in the [Updating.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md) so we can assign it to a appropriate release\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n",
