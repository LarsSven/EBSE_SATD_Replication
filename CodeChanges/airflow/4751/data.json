  "body": "### Jira\r\n* My PR addresses the following https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3607 and references them in the PR title\r\n* Decreasing scheduler delay between tasks\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n* The delay between tasks can be a major issue, especially when we have dags with many subdags,\r\n  figures out that the scheduling process spends plenty of time in dependency checking,  we took the\r\n  trigger rule dependency which calls the db for each task instance,  we made it call the db just once for\r\n  each dag_run.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n* My pr uses very basic parts of the code and also has a fall back to the original behaviour, the ci covers most of the logic and cases that might happen already, I added a unit/integration test that checks the function that has most of the new logic \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n* removed unnecessary queries  - run on each dag run instead of each ti\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nno need for new docs\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n* Passes `flake8`\r\n* Tested in production environment for 3 days\r\n\r\n### Results\r\nThe tests was made on a heavily multitasks dag (35 tasks).\r\nThe tasks don't do any db queries\r\n\r\n**On local environment**\r\nbefore changes:\r\n- avg delay between tasks: 4.22 sec\r\n- number of queries during 10 minutes: 118,879 \r\n\r\nafter collecting dep check queries:\r\n- avg delay between tasks: 3.86 sec\r\n- number of queries during 10 minutes: 104,397\r\n\r\nStress test - running the dag for every 10 sec for an hour:\r\nbefore changes: \r\n- avg delay between tasks: 16.7 sec\r\n- number of queries: 943,230\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n- avg delay between tasks: 3.28 sec\r\n- number of queries: 734,563\r\n\r\n**On production environment**\r\nbefore changes:\r\n- avg delay between tasks: 2.45 sec\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n- avg delay between tasks: 2.16 sec\r\n\r\nStress test - running with 150 other dags:\r\nbefore changes: \r\n - avg delay between tasks: 6.3 sec\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n - avg delay between tasks: 4.74 sec\r\n\r\n### Edit\r\nwe recently did a stress test to check this change again with version 1.10.4\r\nwe did the test on a staging like production environment with one dag with 49 tasks that starts once a minute  :\r\n- max delay was decreased by 30%\r\n- db cpu was decreased by 20% \r\n- avg delay was decreased 18%\r\n\r\nThis is a graph of the time delay between two tasks in the dag by time:\r\n- With improvement(first segment): 14:30-16:30\r\n- Without improvement(last segment): 18:10-20:10\r\n<img width=\"770\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-03 at 20 47 22\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6268317/68576601-10575680-0477-11ea-8928-35c210cc903e.png\">\r\n\r\nThis graph shows the db read iops difference which can explain the change  (the times are different because this is in utc)\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-10 at 17 21 41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6268317/68578056-f0756200-0479-11ea-9cc0-a4526aa9d648.png)\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nThe query that we changed indeed had a dramatic impact on the performance of the scheduler. Reusing db results decreased the delay notably and gave the system chance to recover from stress. ",
