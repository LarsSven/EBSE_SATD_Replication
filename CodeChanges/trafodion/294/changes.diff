-This page describes how to build the Trafodion source code.
-
-# Prerequisites
-You need to [Setup Build Environment](setup-build-environment.html) before trying to build the Trafodion source code.
-
-# Download Source
-You should already have downloaded the source code when setting up the build environment.
-
-## Git
-Please refer to [Making Changes](develop.html#making_changes) on the [Develop](develop.html) page.
-
-## tar file
-The source code for Apache Trafodion can be downloaded from [Apache Trafodion Incubator Release](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator) as a tar file.  
-
-* Download the source tar file to your **```<trafodion download directory>```**.
-* Check the tar file validity by checking signatures, please refer to [Verify Signatures](release.html#Verify_Signatures). The Trafodion releases have been signed using The GNU Privacy Guard. 
-
-**Unpack the tar file**
-     
-     cd <trafodion download directory>
-     tar -xzf <tar file>
-
-# Set Up Environmental Variables
-Start a new **```ssh```** session. Use the following commands to set up the Trafodion environmental variables.
-
-    cd <Trafodion source directory>
-    export TOOLSDIR=<tools installation directory>
-    source ./env.sh
-
-* **```<Trafodion source directory>```**: Source tree base for Trafodion.
-* **```<tools installation directory>```**:  where Trafodion required tools are located. The following example assumes that you installed all the required tools in a single location. If you installed or used pre-installed tools in different directories, then you need to export the location of each tool as described in [Build Tools Manual Installation](build-tools-manual.html) prior to sourcing in **```env.sh```**.
-
-# Build Commands
-Build a debug version of Trafodion using one of the following options.
-
-Command                             | What It Builds
-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-**```make all```**                  | Trafodion, DCS, and REST.
-**```make package```**              | Trafodion, DCS, REST, and Client Drivers.
-**```make package-all```**          | Trafodion, DCS, REST, Client Drivers, and tests for all components.
-
-If the build fails, you might want to rerun the **```make```** step. Trafodion downloads many dependencies and sometimes one of the download operations fail. Rerunning the build generally works.
-
-# Verify Build
-Use **```sqvers -u```** to verify the build.
-
-    $ sqvers -u
-    MY_SQROOT=/home/centos/apache-trafodion-1.3.0-incubating/core/sqf
-    who@host=centos@mysystem
-    JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.91.x86_64
-    SQ_MBTYPE=64d (64-debug)
-    linux=2.6.32-504.1.3.el6.x86_64
-    redhat=6.7
-    NO patches
-    Most common Apache_Trafodion Release 1.3.0 (Build debug [centos], branch -, date 06Nov15)
-    UTT count is 1
-    [6]     Release 1.3.0 (Build debug [centos], branch -, date 06Nov15)
-              export/lib/hbase-trx-cdh5_3-1.3.0.jar
-              export/lib/hbase-trx-hbase_98_4-1.3.0.jar
-              export/lib/hbase-trx-hdp2_2-1.3.0.jar

-              export/lib/trafodion-sql-1.3.0.jar
-
-The output from the **```sqvers -u```** commands should show several jar files. The number of files differs based on the version of Trafodion you downloaded.

-
-These are the C++ coding guidelines that are part of the acceptance criteria for code submitted to the Trafodion. Trafodion reviewers use these guidelines when reviewing changes.
-
-The guidelines describe practices that are either required or preferred. In addition, areas where there is no preference between two or more practices are described.
-
-Trafodion is composed of several distinct sub-projects, some of which have coding guidelines that differ from the Trafodion standard; for example, a requirement in most areas of the code may be only preferred in others.
-
-There may also be existing code that violates one or more of the published requirements. The intent is to correct these over time, and corrections are encouraged when changing code to make a fix or implement new functionality. However, changes that are solely coding guideline changes are not recommended since this places undue burden on the reviewers.
-
-# Header Files
-Keep **<code>#include</code>** directives to a minimum in header files. 
-
-You may forward declare classes and structs when the only use within the header file is a pointer or reference. While includes should be kept to a minimum, if something is used in a header file and cannot be forward declared, it must be explicitly included. 
-
-All files, headers and implementation, should include everything they need to be self-sufficient. They should never assume something will be pre-included. In other words, the contents of a header file should compile cleanly by itself. To help ensure this, all implementation files should include their respective header file first.
-
-Header files should not contain declarations for public items that are only used by the implementation file. Public items that are require in the implementation file but not the header file should be declared in the implementation file. The preference is NOT to create header files that consist only of includes of other header files.
-
-Declare as little as possible in the header file and keep as much of the actual implementation private as is reasonable. For instance, don’t include in a header file declarations of types, enums, and functions that are only referenced by the implementation file.
-
-## Including Standard Header Files
-The preference is for C++ style includes over C style includes for standard header files.
-
-    //Preferred
-    #include <cstdio>
-    //Accepted
-    #include <stdio.h>
-
-## Include Guards
-All header files must use include guards. The name of the include guard **<code>#define</code>** should be the filename in all uppercase, with underscore used in place of periods.
-
-For instance, if the header file is named **<code>ServerInterface_ODBC.h</code>**, the header file should begin and end as follows:
-
-    #ifndef SERVERINTERFACE_ODBC_H
-    #define SERVERINTERFACE_ODBC_H
-    ...
-    #endif /* SERVERINTERFACE_ODBC_H */
-
-Comments following the **<code>#endif</code>** indicating the include guard are preferred.
-
-# Variable Declaration and Naming Standards
-Trafodion uses a combination of Pascal and Camel case. 
-
-* Pascal case means that the first letter in each word in an identifier is capitalized. 
-* Camel case is similar except the first letter is in lower case. 
-
-For both, underscores are **not** used to separate words. The general rule is that identifiers with local scope start with a lower case letter and identifiers with global scope start with an upper case letter.
-
-    //Pascal case
-    class AuthenticationMessage; 
-    //Camel case (aka lower Camel case or camelCase)
-    int logonCount; 
-    Class Names
-
-Class names should be Pascal case and should describe the object contents (not what it does), with as little abbreviation as possible. When names include acronyms, the acronyms should be in all upper case.
-
-**Acceptable Examples**
-
-    //Preferred
-     
-    class SQLSessionContext; // an object that contains the context for a SQL session
-    class PrivilegeList; // a list of privileges
-
-**Poor Examples**
-
-    class OutputInfo; // Doesn’t describe class contents, no context
-    class ReadTableDef; // Describes what class does, not contents
-    class Cmdline_Args; // Prefer Pascal case, no underscore, for class names
-
-## Class Member Variable Names
-Private member data variables should be suffixed with an underscore and should use Camel case. When names include acronyms, the acronyms should be in all upper or all lower case, dependent on which case the first letter should be.
-
-**Example**
-
-    class Employee
-    {
-    public:
-       Employee ();
-    private:
-       std::string firstName_; 
-       std::string lastName_; 
-       uint16_t    departmentNumber_;
-       std::string departmentName_;
-       uint32_t    irsSSN_;
-    }
-
-## Function Names
-Class member functions and static file functions should use Camel case. External non-class functions should use Pascal case. Except for constructors, destructors, and operators, the function name should include a verb that describes the action the function is performing.
-
-**Good Examples**
-
-    //Class member functions
-    int32_t getSalary() const;
-    int32_t setAuthID();
-    int32_t closeAllCursors();
-
-**Bad Examples**
-
-    // Is it setting break enabled, returning it or ???
-    int32_t SQLCLI_BreakEnabled();
-
-## Enums
-Enum types should use Pascal case and describe the class of enums. If the enum is declared outside of a class, the type name should include an indication of the scope of the enums.
-
-Enums themselves should be declared as all upper case. The names may begin with a common prefix or be independent, depending on the usage.
-
-When enums represent an arbitrary set of return values (that is, error codes, state codes, etc.), then avoid the values -1, 0, and 1 if using weakly typed enums, to reduce the chance of matches with Booleans or uninitialized variables.
-
-The preference is to declare enums as strongly typed.
-
-    enum class EnumName {...};
-
-## Boolean Variables
-Boolean variables names should include a verb, state, and optionally a noun (object whose state is in question) indicating the nature of the Boolean. Any combination is acceptable, however verbState is the most common.
-
-**Good Examples**
-
-    bool isValid;           // verbState
-    bool isValidTable;      // verbStateNoun
-    bool tableIsDroppable;  // nounVerbState
-    bool hasData;           // verbState
-
-**Bad Examples**
-
-    bool valid;
-    bool tableState;
-    bool empty;
-
-Functions that return a Boolean should also have names of the form verbState or verbStateNoun if the functions return state information. (This naming standard does not apply to functions returning Boolean as indication of success or failure.)
-
-**Good Examples**
-
-    bool isValidHbaseName();
-    bool isHostNameExcluded();
-    bool canUseCbServer();
-
-**Bad Examples**
-
-    // Don’t use get for Boolean accessors
-    bool getUDRAccessModeViolation(); 
-    
-    // Don’t use integer return for Boolean functions
-    short existsInHBase();
-    
-    // Function name implies it is sending settings to the compiler, but it is
-    // actually only returning an indication that settings should be sent.  
-    // A better name would be shouldSendSettingsToCompiler().
-    bool sendSettingsToCompiler();
-
-Parts of Trafodion code use one of two Boolean typedefs, **<code>NABoolean</code>** and **<code>ComBoolean</code>**, declared as follows:
-
-    typedef int   Int32;
-    typedef Int32 NABoolean;
-    typedef NABoolean ComBoolean;
-    const NABoolean  TRUE = (1 == 1);
-    const NABoolean  FALSE = (0 == 1);
-
-Exercise care when mixing usage of bool and **<code>NABoolean</code>**/**<code>ComBoolean</code>** types, as the latter are not guaranteed to only contain values of TRUE and FALSE. The use of non-standard Boolean types is gradually being phased out.
-
-## Constants
-All constant names should be all upper case, regardless of how the constant is declared. That is, enums, defines, and variables with the **<code>const</code>** modifier should be named in all upper case.
-
-Defines, enums, and const are all permitted and used throughout Trafodion, although most code in Trafodion uses enum for numerical constants and defines for character constants. 
-
-For new code, the use of const char or string is preferred for character constants instead of defines.
-
-## Namespace Names
-The preference is for namespaces to be all lower case, with preference to single words (note the exception to the rule that a name with global scope should start with an upper case). 
-
-If a namespace must be dual-worded, use underscores. If mixed case names are used, Pascal case is preferred.
-
-**Examples**
-
-    //Preferred
-    
-    namespace compiler 
-    //Accepted
-    
-    namespace Compiler
-
-# Indentation and Formatting
-## Indentation
-TAB characters are not permitted in source files except for text files (for example, makefiles) that require them.
-
-Trafodion code uses several indenting depths, including 2, 3, 4, and 8 spaces. Most common is 2 and 3. 
-
-Use the style found in existing code, and when writing new code, use either 2, 3, or 4, and remain consistent.
-
-A variety of control block indentation styles are used throughout Trafodion, most commonly Allman, Whitesmith, Stroustrup, and GNU. Follow the predominant style when making small to medium changes to existing code. For new code, the Allman style is preferred.
-
-    //Allman
-       if (x > 5)
-       {
-          error = doThis(x);
-          if (error != 0)
-          {
-             return false;
-          }
-       }
-       else
-       {
-          doThat(x);
-       }
-    
-    //Whitesmith
-       if (x > 5)
-          {
-          error = doThis(x);
-          if (error != 0)
-             {
-             return false;
-             }
-          }
-       else
-          {
-          doThat(x);
-          }
-    
-    //Stroustrup 
-       if (x > 5) {
-          error = doThis(x);
-          if (error != 0) {
-              return false;
-          }
-       }
-       else {
-          doThat(x);
-       }
-
-Note that the Stroustrup and the similar K&R formats were popularized by usage in books where conservation of line count was a goal.
-
-    //GNU
-      if (x > 5)
-        {
-          error = doThis(x);
-          if (error != 0)
-            {
-              return false;
-            }
-        }
-      else
-        {
-          doThat(x);
-        }
-
-# Comments
-## Comment Style
-C++ style comments are preferred, but C comments are acceptable as well.
-
-Some code uses Doxygen style comments, but this is not required.
-
-## When/Where Comments Should Be Used
-Every file should have a comment at the beginning describing the purpose of the file.
-
-In header files where classes are declared, there should be a comment describing the class, including purpose and usage. Also describe anything out of the ordinary, such as the use of multiple inheritance.
-
-Within implementation files, in addition to the comment at the beginning of the file, add comments for any global or static variables defined in the file, and how the variable is handled in a multi-threaded environment (if applicable).
-
-Also, for each function defined, describe the purpose and intent of the function. For each parameter, list whether it is input or output (or both), how it is used, and any range restrictions imposed. For functions not returning void, describe the possible return values.
-
-Within the body of the function, there is no need to write comments that document the obvious. But if there is any complexity to the logic, at a minimum document the intent, and consider documenting the details (assumptions, limits, unexpected side effects from function calls, etc.)
-
-If a feature is only partially implemented, add a comment indicating at a high level what work remains. Prefix the comment with //TODO.
-
-    //TODO Code is currently not thread safe.  Need to protect allocation of ...
-
-# Error Handling
-## Asserts
-Trafodion uses asserts in the "debug" build. Use asserts freely, but ensure they do not contain any side effects as the code is not present in the "release" build.
-
-## Error Return/Retrieval
-Avoid the use of integer return codes for success and error codes. Instead, use bool for simple succeeded/failed and enum types for returns with multiple conditions.
-
-## Exception Handling
-Trafodion code mixes usage of exceptions and error returns. When using try/catch blocks, keep the scope as small as possible. Ensure all exceptions thrown are handled, potentially in main() if nowhere else.
-
-# General Guidelines
-## Casting
-Avoid using C-style casts. Use C++-style casts instead, as they are often safer and easier to search for.
-
-    //Preferred
-    
-    int x = static_cast<int>(shortVariable);
-    
-    MyType *myVar = reinterpret_cast<MyType *>(voidPtr);
-
-Don’t blindly cast to remove a compiler error or warning. Ensure the cast is safe.
-
-Use const casting sparingly. Often the use of mutable or changing a function to be const correct is a better solution.
-
-## Types
-Use standard types defined in **<code>\<cstdint\></code>** or **<code>\<stdint.h\></code>**. Note that Trafodion defines and uses many non-standard types (for example, **<code>Int32</code>**, **<code>Lng32</code>**), but this usage is being phased out.
-
-Use types with explicit sizes (for example, **<code>int32_t</code>**, **<code>int64_t</code>**) when size is a factor in the code, such as an external API, or column in a table. 
-
-Where size is not a factor (counters, indexes) a non-sized type such as **<code>int</code>** or **<code>long</code>** may be used. However, in general, **<code>size_t</code>** and **<code>ssize_t</code>** are preferred for variables where fixed size is not required.

--->
-This page describes how to create the test environment used for Trafodion development, which is intended for people that are contributing to the Trafodion source tree. Please refer to [Download](download.html) if you want to try the Trafodion product environment.
-
-# Prerequisites
-The following prerequisites need to be met in order to create a functional Trafodion test environment.
-
-## Passwordless ```ssh```
-Check to see if you have passwordless SSH setup correctly.
-
-    ssh localhost
-    Last login: Fri Nov  6 22:44:00 2015 from 192.168.1.9
-
-If the **```ssh localhost```** command prompts for a password, then passwordless **```ssh```** is not set up correctly.
-
-The following is an example of setting up passwordless **```ssh```** using **```id_rsa```** keys. You can choose the method that best represents your environment.
-
-If you already have an existing set of **```ssh```** keys. Simply copy both the **```id_rsa.pub```** and **```id_rsa```** to your **```~/.ssh```** directory.
-
-Then, do the following to modify your **```ssh```** environment.
-
-    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
-    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
-    echo "NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost=yes" >>~/.ssh/config
-    chmod go-w ~/.ssh/config
-    chmod 755 ~/.ssh; chmod 640 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys; cd ~/.ssh; chmod 700 ..
-
-If you need to create your keys first, then do the following.
-
-    rm -rf ~/.ssh
-    ssh-keygen -t rsa -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
-    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
-    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub 
-    echo "NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost=yes" >>~/.ssh/config
-    chmod go-w ~/.ssh/config
-    chmod 755 ~/.ssh; chmod 640 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys; cd ~/.ssh; chmod 700 ..
-
-## System Limits
-Please check that the system limits in your environment are appropriate for Apache Trafodion. If they are not, then you will need to increase the limits or Trafodion cannot start.
-
-The recommended settings are as follows.
-
-    $ ulimit –a
-    core file size             (blocks, -c) 1000000
-    data seg size              (kbytes, -d) unlimited
-    scheduling priority        (-e) 0
-    file size                  (blocks, -f) unlimited
-    pending signals            (-i) 515196
-    max locked memory          (kbytes, -l) 49595556
-    max memory size            (kbytes, -m) unlimited
-    open files                 (-n) 32000
-    pipe size                  (512 bytes, -p) 8
-    POSIX message queues       (bytes, -q) 819200
-    real-time priority         (-r) 0
-    stack size                 (kbytes, -s) 10240
-    cpu time                   (seconds, -t) unlimited
-    max user processes         (-u) 267263
-    virtual memory             (kbytes, -v) unlimited
-    file locks                 (-x) unlimited
-
-Please refer to this [article](http://www.itworld.com/article/2693414/setting-limits-with-ulimit.html) for information on how you change system limits.
-
-# Setup
-You can create a Trafodion test environment using a:
-
-* **Pre-Installed Hadoop**: Trafodion installation on a system that already has a compatible version of Hadoop installed
-* **Local Hadoop**: You install a Hadoop environment using the **```install_local_hadoop```** script
-
-Your installation approach depends on whether you already have installed Hadoop.
-
-## Pre-Installed Hadoop
-Use the following instructions if you're installing Trafodion on a pre-installed Hadoop environment. 
-### Build Binary tar Files
-Build the Trafodion binary tar files.
-
-    cd <Trafodion source directory>
-    make package
-
-### Install Trafodion
-Please refer to the installation instructions described in the [Installation](install.html) page.
-
-## Local Hadoop
-Use the following instructions if you need to install a local Hadoop environment.
-### Run ```install_local_hadoop```
-The **```install_local_hadoop```** script downloads compatible versions of Hadoop, HBase, Hive, and MySQL. Then, it starts Trafodion.
-
-<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
-  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&close;</button>
-  <p style="color:black"><strong>Time Saver</strong></p>
-  <p style="color:black"><strong>```install_local_hadoop```</strong> downloads Hadoop, HBase, Hive, and MySql jar files from the Internet. To avoid this overhead, you can download the required files into a separate directory and set the environment variable <strong>```MY_LOCAL_SW_DIST```</strong> to point to this directory.</p>
-</div>
-
-Command                                        | Usage
------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------
-**```install_local_hadoop```**                 | Uses default ports for all services.
-**```install_local_hadoop -p fromDisplay```**  | Start Hadoop with a port number range determined from the DISPLAY environment variable.
-**```install_local_hadoop -p rand```**         | Start with any random port number range between 9000 and 49000.
-**```install_local_hadoop -p <port>```**       | Start with the specified port number.
-
-For a list of ports that get configured and their default values, please refer to [Port Assignments](port-assignment.html).
-
-### Sample Procedure
-Start a new **```ssh```** session and ensure that the Trafodion environmental variables are loaded.
-
-    cd <Trafodion source directory>
-    source ./env.sh
-
-Install the Hadoop software.
-
-    cd $MY_SQROOT/sql/scripts
-    install_local_hadoop
-    ./install_traf_components
-
-Verify installation.
-
-    $ swstatus
-    6 java servers and 2 mysqld processes are running
-    713   NameNode
-    19513 HMaster
-    1003  SecondaryNameNode
-    838   DataNode
-    1173  ResourceManager
-    1298  NodeManager
-
-Six java servers as shown above and two mysqld processes should be running.
-
-# Install and Build Trafodion
-Please refer to [Modify Code](code.html) for information on how to install and build Trafodion from its source code.
-
-# New Source Download
-You need to do the following each time you download new source code.

-
-# Initial Setup
-This set of tasks is performed **after** downloading the git tools. Refer to [Development Environment](#development_environment) above.
-
-You should not have to perform these tasks more than once.
-
-## Setting Up the Git Enviroment
-If you have not done so already, now is the time to set up your **<code>git</code>** environment. Refer to the [GitHub Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) for information on how to set up your Git environment. Please ensure that you register your [ssh keys](https://github.com/settings/ssh).
-
-## Fork the Trafodion Repository
-You create a private fork of Trafodion on <https://github.com/apache/incubator-trafodion>. Use the **fork** button top-right on the page to create your fork, which will be named **\<your-git-id\>_fork.**
-
-The following examples use **trafdeveloper** to represent **\<your-git-id\>**.
-
-## Clone the Trafodion Repository
-Use the **git shell** to perform this task.
-
-    # Move to the directory where you want to install the Trafodion source code.
-    cd mysource
-    # Clone the Trafodion source code
-    git clone git://git.apache.org/incubator-trafodion.git
-    # Register your fork as a remote branch
-    git remote add trafdeveloper_fork git@github.com:trafdeveloper/incubator-trafodion
-
-At this point, you've finished all preparation steps. Now, you can start making changes.
-
-# Making Changes
-## Create a Task Branch
-You create a task branch to make changes to the Trafodion source. Typically, we name the branches after the Jira we are working on. In this example, the Jira is: **TRAFODION-1507**.
-
-    # Ensure that you have the latest changes
-    git fetch --all
-    # Checkout source
-    git checkout -b TRAFODION-1507 origin/master
-   
-<table><tr><td>
-  <p><strong>Note</strong></p>
-  <p>The source tar file has been signed with pgp key A44C5A05, which is included in the download location's
-     <a href="https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/trafodion/KEYS">KEYS file</a>
-  </p>
-</td></tr></table>
-
-
-## Change Recipes
-The procedure to make changes depends on what type of problem or feature you're working on.
-
-Change Type                      | Refer To
----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------
-**Code**                         | [Modify Code](code.html)
-**Documentation**                | [Modify Documentation](document.html)
-**QA Tests**                     | [Modify Tests](tests.html)
-**Web Site**                     | [Modify Web Site](website.html)
-
-## Commit Changes
-
-<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
-  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&close;</button>
-  <p style="color:black"><strong>Reminder</strong></p>
-  <p style="color:black">If making code changes: please ensure that you run the <a href="testing.html">Regression Tests</a> before committing changes.</p>
-</div>
-
-Perform the following steps to commit your changes.
-
-    # Commit changes
-    git commit -a
-    # Dry-run check
-    git push -n trafdeveloper_fork HEAD
-    # Push changes to your private fork
-    git push trafdeveloper_fork TRAFODION-1507
-
-## Create Pull Request
-Your changed code needs to be reviewed by a Trafodion committer. Therefore, you need to create a pull request for your private repositoryc.
-
-    # Generate pull request
-    git pull-request
-
-Ensure that you include the Jira ID at the beginning of the title in your pull request. For example:
-
-    [TRAFODION-1507] Explanation of the changes you made.
-
-[Automated Tests](#automated_tests) are normally triggered to run on every pull request. If you have modified the documentation or the web site, then you can skip the automated testing by adding the following phrase to the comments of the pull request:
-
-    jenkins, skip test
-
-## Review Comments
-The pull request gets reviewed by the committers and once you get a consensus, then the committer merges your changes into the main incubator-trafodion branch.
-
-## Address Review Comments
-Follow the GitHub conversation on your pull request (you should be automatically subscribed). Respond to questions and issues.
-
-If you need to make additional changes, then do the following:
-
-1. Check out the code: **<code>git checkout TRAFODION-1507</code>**
-2. Make the requested changes.
-3. Run regression tests.
-4. Commit the changes: **<code>git commit -a</code>**
-5. Push the changes back to your private git fork: **<code>git push trafdeveloper_fork TRAFODION-1507</code>**
-
-## Merge Changes
-If all is well, a committer will merge your change into the Apache repository, which is mirrored on github.
-
-You may be asked to close out the JIRA or other follow up.
-
-Your change is done. Thanks for your contribution to Trafodion.
-
-# Automated Tests
-Automated tests take several hours to complete from when your pull-request was approved by a committer or updated with a new commit.
-
-Normally, the Traf-Jenkins user will post a message in the pull-request with a link to the results. You can also check the Jenkins server to see the status even before the tests are finished. Look in the **Build History** table for the build/test job that matches your pull-request. For example, the master branch tests are located at: <https://jenkins.esgyn.com/job/Check-PR-master/>
-
-## Reviewing Logs
-
-There are two approaches to reviewing logs.
-
-### Approach 1
-
-* The first two columns in build-job table are links to the specific sub-job. Clicl on the link to drill down.
-* The console log of each job has a link to the log file directories (close to the top). Look for **Detailed logs**.
-
-### Approach 2
-
-* Go to: <http://traf-logs.esgyn.com/PullReq/>
-* Click on the number of the pull request. The next directory level is the build number. With multiple commits or re-tests, it is possible for a pull request to have multiple builds.
-* Under the build number is a directory for each specific job. Example: <http://traf-logs.esgyn.com/PullReq/18/35/regress-seabase-ahw2.2/>
-
-## More Information
-The check tests do not include all of the automated daily tests. If you (or another contributor) want, you can run additional tests on the pull request. Refer [automated test setup (TBD)](automated-tests.html) for more information.

-## Source Tree Organization
-
-### DCS and REST
-
-### All Other
-All other documents share a common web-book stylesheet definition, which is located in **```docs/css/trafodion-manuals.css```**.
-
-The source tree for each manual is organized as follows:
-
-File/Directory                                | Content
-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-**```pom.xml```**                             | Maven Project Object Model (POM) used to build the document. 
-**```src/```**                                | The source files used to define the document.
-**```src/asciidoc```**                        | Asciidoc files for the document.
-**```src/asciidoc/index.adoc```**             | Main asciidoc defining the document. Includes the different chapters from the **```_chapters```** directory.
-**```src/asciidoc/_chapters/```**             | Source files for the different chapters in the document.
-**```images/```**                             | Images used in the document.
-**```resources/```**                          | Other include materials; for example, source examples that are included with the document.
-**```target/```**                             | Build output directory. Contains the web book, the PDF file, and supporting directories.
-**```target/index.pdf```**                    | Generated PDF version of the document.
-**```target/images/```**                      | Copy of the **```images/```** directory.
-**```target/resources/```**                   | Copy of the **```resources/```** directory.
-**```target/site/```**                        | Generated web-book directory.

-**```target/site/css/```**                    | Stylesheets related to the web book. The common stylesheet is included in the index.html file.
-**```target/site/images/```**                 | Copy of the **```images/```** directory.
-**```target/site/resources/```**              | Copy of the **```resources/```** directory.
-  
-# Making Changes
-
-Please refer to the following web sites for guidance for information about working on asciidoc-based documentation.
-
-* [DCS Contributing to Documentation](https://github.com/apache/incubator-trafodion/blob/master/dcs/src/main/asciidoc/_chapters/appendix_contributing_to_documentation.adoc) 
-* [AsciiDoc User Guide](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/chunked/index.html)
-* [AsciiDoc cheatsheet](http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc)
-* [PDF Theme](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf/blob/master/docs/theming-guide.adoc)
-
-Once you have made the desired changes, then do the following:
-
-## Building an Individual Document
-
-1. Be sure to source env.sh, so that the TRAFODION_VER environment variable is defined.
-2. Build the document using **```mvn clean site```** in the directory containing the document; for example: **```dcs```** or **```docs/odb_user```**.
-   * If you have not previously built the JDBC drivers, the DCS and REST documents will give spurious errors about missing that dependency. The documents can be built fine, skipping over that dependency using **```mvn -P'!jdbc' site```**.
-3. Verify the content in the generated **```target```** directory. 
-   * The **```target/index.html```** file provides the entry point for the web book. 
-   * For those that have API documentation, the **```target/apidocs/index.html```** file contains the entry point.
-   * For those that have PDF, the **```target/index.pdf```** file contains the PDF version of the document.
-
-## Building the Entire Website, including Documents
-
-1. Be sure to source env.sh, so that the TRAFODION_VER environment variable is defined.
-2. Build everything using **```mvn clean post-site```** in the top-level directory.
-   * As above, to skip over JDBC dependency, use **```mvn -P'!jdbc' post-site```**.
-3. Verify the contents in the generated **```docs/target```** directory.
-   * All documents are in **```docs/target/docs```** directory.
-
-# Build Trafodion Document Tree
-The external version of the Trafodion Document Tree is published to http://trafodion.incubator.apache.org/docs. Please refer to [Publish](#publish) below.
-
-The build version of the  Trafodion Document Tree is located in **```docs/target/docs```**, which is created when you build the Trafodion web site in Maven. 
-
-## Version Directories
-
-The Trafodion Document Tree consists of **Version Directories**:
-
-Version Directory           | Content                                           | Web Site Directory
-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------
-**```latest```**            | Known place for the latest version of a document. | **```trafodion.incubator.apache.org/docs/<document-name>```**
-**```<version>```**         | Release-specific version of a document.           | **```trafodion.incubator.apache.org/docs/<version>/<document-directory>```**
-
-* **```latest```**: Provides a well-known place for each document. This practice makes it possible to link to a document in instructional text, web sites, and
-other documents.
-* **```<version>```**: Provides per-release versions of documents. Previous versions are kept in the web site's git repository ensuring that previous versions of the documentation are available.
-
-## Document Directories
-Each document is placed in its own **Document Directory**:
-
-Document                  | Document Directory Name
---------------------------|------------------------------------------
-Client Installation Guide | **```client_install```**
-Command Interface Guide   | **```command_interface```**
-DCS Reference Guide       | **```dcs_reference```**
-odb User Guide            | **```odb_user```**
-REST Reference Guide      | **```rest_reference```**
-SQL Reference Manual      | **```sql_reference```**
-
-The Document Directories are organized as follows. Files and sub-directories may or may not be present in the Document Directory depending on document. 
-
-File/Directory               | Content
------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-**```*.pdf```**              | The PDF version of the document. For example, **```Trafodion_SQL_Reference_Guide.pdf```**.
-**```index.html```**         | The web book version of the document. Generated by asciidoc.
-**```apidocs```**            | API documentation provided as a web book. Generated by javadoc.
-**```apidocs/index.html```** | Entry point for API documentation. Generated by javadoc.
-**```css```**                | CSS definitions used by the web-version of the document. Populated by asciidoc.
-**```images```**             | Images used by the web-version of the document. Populated by asciidoc.
-**```resouces```**           | Resource files referenced for source download etc. Populated by asciidoc.
-
-The Document Directories are copied under the Version Directories thereby creating the web-accessible Trafodion document tree.

-
-# Automated Testing
-You can interact with Jenkins testing via pull request (PR) comments. All of these commands should start with "jenkins," to not confuse other users. You can add more to the end of the message if you want. Jenkins just pattern matches the string, and will ignore trailing comments.
-
-* If an unknown user submits a PR, then Jenkins automation will post a message to github asking if it is okay to test.
-    * Review the pull request. If the code is not malicious and is okay to test, post a comment <pre>jenkins, ok</pre>
-
-* If the author is a trusted contributor, you can add them to a white-list of known users.
-    * Post a comment <pre>jenkins, add user</pre>
-
-* Consider inviting them to the **```trafodion-contributors```** github group as well.
-    * New commits to the PR will trigger a new build. You can also trigger a retest without a new commit.
-    * Post a comment <pre>jenkins, retest</pre>
-    
-# Validate Review Criteria
-The project committee (PPMC) has agreed that the following review criteria are used for contributions:
-
-* Code Review(s)
-* Time available for comments
-* Testing
-    * **Be sure that you wait for all pending tests!**
-    * New commits, even those that are just merging with latest master branch, trigger new test run.
-* Legal
-* Other
-

-This page describes how to create a Trafodion release. You have to be a Trafodion committer to use these instructions.
-
-# Prerequisites
-
-## Create PGP Key
-If you haven't done so already, then you need to create a PGP key so that you can sign the release. Please refer to: http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#generate-key.
-
-Please remember to store your private key in a secure place.
-
-**Example**
-
-    gpg --gen-key   (verify that sha1 is avoided (last on list – see above web site)
-    gpg -k  (shows public key)
-    gpg -K (shows private key)
-
-### Upload Public Key
-Upload your public key to a public key server. We recommend using https://pgp.mit.edu/.
-
-**Example**
-
-    gpg --send-keys <keyID> --keyserver pgp.mit.edu
-
-### Create Revocation Certificate
-Create a revocation certification using the instructions at: http://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html#revocation-certs.
-
-Please remember to store it in a secure place separate from your PGP keys.
-
-**Example**
-
-    gpg --output revoke-<keyD>.asc --armor --gen-revoke <keyID>
-
-# Add PGP to KEYS File
-Do the following:
-
-    svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator/trafodion traf_release
-    cd traf_release 
-    gpg --list-sigs <keyID> >> KEYS
-    gpg  -armor –export <keyID>
-    svn commit –m “added new public key to KEYS file“
-
-# Prepare Artifacts
-## Prepare New Release
-
-1. Send a message out to the community indicating that a new release is being planned.  In this message, indicate what is planned for the release and when the release is scheduled.
-2. Give contributors enough time to assimilate this information so they can make plans to deliver their changes.  Recommend giving the community several weeks notice.
-3. Review open issues and planned features; determine what JIRA's should be included in the release.
-
-## Verify Release Requirements
-You need to ensure that:
-
-* A DISCLAIMER file exists in the top level directory containing correct information. Please refer to: http://incubator.apache.org/guides/branding.html#disclaimers.
-* NOTICE and LICENSE files exist in the top level directory which includes all third party licenses used in the product. Please refer to:  http://www.apache.org/dev/licensing-howto.html.
-* A README file exists and is up to date in the top level directory describing the release.
-* The source release contains source code only, no binaries.
-* The provenance of all source files is clear.
-* All source files have Apache license headers, where possible.  Where not possible, then the exceptions are written up in the RAT_README file located in the top level directory.
-* RAT report is clean.
-* Copyright dates are current.
-* Build instructions are provided and can be run successfully.
-* Test instructions are provided and can be run successfully.
-
-## Create Release Branch
-Prior to releasing, send a message to the community indicating that a new release is imminent and that a new branch will be created to build the artifacts.
-
-After the new release branch is created, send another message to the community indicating that the branch is available and the deliveries will be monitored.  Allow deliveries on the main branch to continue.
-
-Verify that all required changes have been delivered.
-
-## Create Artifacts
-Trafodion uses git as its repository.  When a new version is created, mark the repository with the tag to make sure it source tar can be recreated.
-
-### Create Tag
-
-**Example: Release x.x.x and release candidate 1 (rc1)**
-
-    git checkout -b tagx.x.x <release branch name>
-    git tag -a x.x.xrc1
-    git show x.x.xrc1
-    git push apache x.x.xrc1
-    git tag
-
-Once completed, a new source tar file exist in the distribution directory. 
-
-### Create Artifact Checksums and Signatures
-**Assumption**: You've already created the signing key and registered it at the https://pgp.mit.edu/ repository.
-
-    gpg --armor --output apache-trafodion-x.x.x-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc --detach-sig apache-trafodion-x.x.x-incubating-src.tar.gz
-    gpg --verify apache-trafodion-x.x.x-incubating-src.tar.gz.asc
-    md5sum apache-trafodion-x.x.x-incubating-src.tar.gz > apache-trafodion-x.x.x-incubating-src.tar.gz.md5
-    sha1sum apache-trafodion-x.x.x-incubating-src.tar.gz > apache-trafodion-x.x.x-incubating-src.tar.gz.sha 
-
-# Test Artifacts
-
-## Build and Test Source tar File
-Build and test the source tar file using the [Build Trafodion](build.html) instructions. You should perform this test on the following environments:
-
-* Test build on a fresh VM.
-* Test build using the tagged version from git
-
-## Compare Tagged Version with Source tar File
-Compare the code from the source tar file with the tagged version to make sure they match. The follow example assumes that the branch artifacts contains the release candidates.
-
-    mkdir traf_test
-    cd traf_test
-    cp <git dir>/incubator-trafodion/distribution/* .
-    tar zxf apache-trafodion-x.x.x-incubating-src.tar.gz
-
-Compare the two versions; for example, by using BCompare and the "Folder Compare Report" feature:
-
-    old: traf_test/incubator-trafodion 
-    new: <git dir>/incubator-trafodion
-
-**Note:**  The git version will have some additional git folders and the distribution directory.
-
-## Verify Apache Requirements
-Verify checksums and signatures using the [Verify Signature](#Verify_Signatures) instructions below.
-
-Ensure that the high-level directory contains valid version of:
-
-* **```DISCLAIMER.txt```**
-* **```LICENSE.txt```**
-* **```NOTICE.txt```**
-* **```RAT_README.txt```**
-* **```README.txt```**
-
-# Stage Artifacts
-Once all the artifacts have been created and tested, then it's time to stage them.  Upload the artifacts to the https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/trafodion directory.
-
-1. Make sure **```svn```** exists. (It can be downloaded using **```yum```**.)
-    * **```which svn```**
-    * **```svn --version```** (version 1.6.11 works)
-2. Create a directory to store the **```svn```** repositoy
-3. Checkout source code. This creates a directory called incubator.
-    * **```svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator```**
-4. **```cd trafodion```**
-5. Create a new directory for the release: **```mkdir apache-trafodion-x.x.x-incubating```**
-6. **```cd <apache-trafodion-x.x.x-incubating>```**
-7. Copy the four files to the incubating directory.
-8. Ensure that you do an **```svn add```** for the new directory and all four files
-9. Ask for a review of the changes
-10. Commit your changes
-    * **```svn status```**
-    * **```svn commit –m "message…"```**
-    * Go to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator to see if your changes were committed
-
-# Verification
-All artifacts have been uploaded to the staging area.
-
-## Verify Signatures
-Download all the artifacts from the staging area including:

-# Verify Java Version
-The Java version must be 1.7.x. Check as following:
-
-    $ java -version
-    java version "1.7.0_85"
-    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (rhel-2.6.1.3.el6_6-x86_64 u85-b01)
-    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.85-b03, mixed mode)
-
-Ensure that the Java environment exists and points to your JDK installation. By default Java is located in **```/usr/lib/java-\<version\>```**.
-
-    $ echo $JAVA_HOME
-    $ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk.x86_64
-
-# Download and Install Source
-The Trafodion source code contains tools that help you set up the build environment.
-## Git
-Please refer to [Making Changes](develop.html#making_changes) on the [Develop](develop.html) page.
-
-## tar file
-The source code for Apache Trafodion can be downloaded from [Apache Trafodion Incubator Release](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/incubator) as a tar file.  
-
-* Download the source tar file to your **```<trafodion download directory>```**.
-* Check the tar file validity by checking signatures, please refer to [Verify Signatures](release.html#Verify_Signatures). The Trafodion releases have been signed using The GNU Privacy Guard. 
-
-**Unpack the tar file**
-     
-     cd <trafodion download directory>
-     tar -xzf <tar file>
-
-# Install Build Tools
-Trafodion requires that several tools are installed in order to build. These tools are:
-
-Tool                                   | Description
----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------
-**Bison**                              | General-purpose parser generator.
-**ICU**                                | Set of C/C++ and Java libraries providing Unicode and Globalization support for software applications.
-**LLVM**                               | Collection of modular and reusable compiler and tool-chain technologies.
-**Maven**                              | Build tool that is only installed if compatible version does not exist.
-**MPICH**                              | An implementation of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard.  For use in Trafodion, MPICH must be built to force sockets to be used in both internode and intranode message passing.
-**Thrift**                             | Communications and data serialization tool.
-**Udis86**                             | Minimalistic disassembler library (libudis86) for the x86 class of instruction set architectures.
-**Zookeeper**                          | Coordination service for distributed applications.  It exposes common services such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services.
-
-You can perform the required installation using the Trafodion **```traf_tools_setup.sh```** script or by installing each tool manually.
-
-## ```traf_tools_setup.sh```
-**```traf_tools_setup.sh```** is a script that uses **```wget```** to download the appropriate tar file, build, and install the required tool into a directory of your choice for each tool required tools.  
-
-The advantage of this method is that all the correct tools are downloaded and built in a single directory.  Before building, a single environment variable needs to be set: **```TOOLSDIR```**.
-
-<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
-  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&close;</button>
-  <p style="color:black"><strong>Note</strong></p>
-  <p style="color:black">You may want to modify <strong><code>traf_tools_setup.sh</code></strong> for your specific environment. Example: if you already have Zoopkeeper installed, you may not want to re-install it.</p>
-  <p style="color:black">You may need root or sudo access to installs the tools in desired locations.</p>
-  <p style="color:black">In the sections below, <strong><code>incubator-trafodion</code></strong> represents the root directory where you installed the Trafodion source.</p>
-</div>
-
-**Usage**
-
-    cd <Trafodion source directory>/install
-    ./traf_tools_setup.sh -h
-    Usage: ./traf_tools_setup.sh -d <downloaddir> -i <installdir>
-    -d <downloaddir> - location of download directory
-    -i <installdir>  - location of install directory
-    -h - help
-    example: traf_tools_setup.sh -d /home/userx/download -i /home/userx/tools
-
-Run **```traf_tools_setup.sh```** to install all dependent tools.
-
-**Example**

-This page describes the Trafodion test suites and their usage.
-
-# Component Tests
-Trafodion comes with several component-specific testing libraries.
-
-## SQL Core
-The SQL core components are written in a combination of C++ and Java. 
-
-You should ensure that the current set of regression tests pass each time you add or modify a SQL feature.
-
-If adding a new feature, then check that it is either covered by an existing regression test or add a new test to an existing test suite.
-
-### Test Suites
-**Location**: ```core/sql/regress```
-
-Directory              | Usage
------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-**```catman1```**      | Tests the Catalog Manager.
-**```charsets```**     | Tests Character Sets.
-**```compGeneral```**  | Compiler test suite; tests optimizer-specific features.
-**```core```**         | Tests a subset/sample of all features from all the test suites.
-**```executor```**     | Tests the SQL Executor.
-**```fullstack2```**   | Similar to core but a very limited subset.
-**```hive```**         | Tests HDFS access to Hive tables.
-**```newregr```**      | Unused/Saved repository for some unpublished features. These are not run.
-**```qat```**          | Tests basic DDL and DML syntax.
-**```seabase```**      | Tests JNI interface to HBase.
-**```tools```**        | Regression driver scripts and general regression scripts.
-**```udr```**          | Tests the User Defined Routines (UDR) and TMUDF functionality.
-
-### Check Test Results
-On completion, the test run prints out a test summary. All tests should pass, or pass with known diffs.
-
-Test results are written to the **```runregr-sb.log```** file in each component's directory. Therefore, you can check the test results after the fact as follows:
-
-    cd $MY_SQROOT/rundir
-    grep FAIL */runregr-sb.log
- 
-A successful test run shows no failures.
-
-### Run Full Test Suite
-This suite tests:
-
-* SQL Compiler
-* SQL Executor
-* Transactions
-* Foundation
-
-
-Do the following:
-
-    cd $MY_SQHOME
-    . ./sqenv.sh
-    cd $MY_SQROOT/../sql/regress
-    tools/runallsb
-
-### Run Individual Test Suites
-You can select individual test suites as follows:
-
-    cd $MY_SQHOME
-    . ./sqenv.sh
-    cd $MY_SQROOT/../sql/regress
-    tools/runallsb <suite1> <suite2>
-
-### Running an Individual Test
-#### If You've Already Run the Test Suite
-If you have already run the suite once, then you will have all your directories set up and you can run one test as follows:
-
-    cd $MY_SQROOT/../sql/regress/<suite>
-    # You can add the following two exports to .bashrc or .profile for convenience
-    export rundir=$MY_SQROOT/rundir
-    export scriptsdir=$MY_SQROOT/../sql/regress
-    # run the test
-    cd $rundir/<suite>
-    $scriptsdir/<suite>/runregr -sb <test>
-
-**Example**
-
-    cd $rundir/executor
-    $scriptsdir/executor/runregr -sb TEST130
-
-#### If You've Not Run the Test Suite
-If you have not run any regression suites so far, then you will not have the required sub directories set up. You manually create them for each suite you want to run.
-
-    cd $MY_SQROOT/../sql/regress/<suite>
-    # You can add the following two exports to .bashrc or .profile for convenience
-    export rundir=$MY_SQROOT/rundir
-    export scriptsdir=$MY_SQROOT/../sql/regress
-    mkdir $rundir
-    cd $rundir
-    # <suitename> should match the name of each directory in $scriptsdir
-    mkdir <suitename>
-    # run the test
-    cd $rundir/<suite>
-    $scriptsdir/<suite>/runregr -sb <test>
-
-### Detecting Failures
-If you see failures in any of your tests, you want to try running that suite or test individually as detailed above.
- 
-Open up the DIFF file and correlate them to the LOG and EXPECTED files.
- 
-* DIFF files are in **```$rundir/<suite name>```**.
-* LOG files are in **```$rundir/<suite name>```**.
-* EXPECTED files are in **```$scriptsdir/<suite name>```**.
- 
-To narrow down the failure, open up the test file (for example: **```TEST130```**) in **```$scriptsdir/executor```**. 
-
-Recreate the problem with a smaller set of SQL commands and create a script to run from **```sqlci```**. If it's an issue that can be recreated only by running the whole suite, you can add a line to the test just before the command that fails to include a **```wait```** or a **```sleep```** **```sh sleep 60```** will make the test pause and give you time to attach the **```sqlci```** process to the debugger. (You can find the PID of the **```sqlci```** process using **```sqps```** on the command line)
- 
-Introducing a **```wait```** in the test will wait forever until you enter a character. This is another way to make the test pause to attach the debugger to the **```sqlci```** process.    
-
-### Modifying an Existing Test
-If you would like to add coverage for your new change, you can modify an existing test.
-
-Run the test after your modifications. If you are satisfied with your results, you need to modify the **```EXPECTED<test number>```** file to reflect your new change. The standard way to do it is to copy the **```LOG<test number>```** file to **```EXPECTED<test number>```** file.
-
-## Database Connectivity Services (DCS)
-The DCS test suite is organized per the Maven standard. 
-
-## JDBC T4
-The code is written in Java, and is built and unit tested using Maven. The test suite organization and use follow Maven standards.
-
-Instructions for setting up and running the test can be found in source tree at **```dcs/src/test/jdbc_test```**.
-
-## ODBC Tests
-The code is written for the Python 2.7 [```unittest```](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html) framework. 
-
-It is run via the **```Testr```** and **```Tox```**. 
-
-    cd dcs/src/test/pytests
-    ./config.sh -d <host>t:<port> -t <Location of your Linux ODBC driver tar file>
-    tox -e py27
-
-Further instructions for setting up and running the test can be found in source tree at **```dcs/src/test/pytests```**.
-
-# Functional Tests
-
-## Phoenix
-The Phoenix tests provides basic functional tests for Trafodion. These tests were originally adapted from their counterpart at salesforce.com.
-
-The tests are executed using Maven with a Python wrapper. You can run them the same way on your own workstation instance just like the way Jenkins runs them. Do the following:
-
-<!-- This part is done in raw HTML because it's too complex to do this level of formatting in markdown. -->
-<ol>
-   <li>Prior to running Phoenix tests, you need to bring up your Trafodion instance and DCS. You need to configure at least 2-4 servers for DCS. The tests need at least two mxosrvrs as they make two connections at any given time. We recommend configuring DCS with four mxosrvrs since we have seen situations that mxosrvrs do not get released in time for the next connection if there are only two mxosrvrs.</li>
-  <li><p>Run the Phoenix tests from source tree</p>
-       <p style="text-indent=20px">
-          <pre>
-cd tests/phx
-phoenix_test.py --target=&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt; --user=dontcare --pw=dontcare --targettype=TR --javahome=&lt;jdk&gt; --jdbccp=&lt;jdir&gt;/jdbcT4.jar</pre>
-          </p>
-       <p style="text-indent=20px">
-         <ul>
-           <li><strong>&lt;host&gt;</strong>: your workstation name or IP address.</li>
-           <li><strong>&lt;port&gt;</strong>: your DCS master port number.</li>
-           <li><strong>&lt;jdk&gt;</strong>:  the directory containing the jdk1.7.0_21_64 or later version of the JDK.</li>
-           <li><strong>&lt;jdir&gt;</strong>: the directory containing your JDBC T4 jar file. (export/lib if you downloaded a Trafodion binary package.)</li>
-         </ul>
-       </p>
-  </li>
-  <li><p>Analyze the results. The test results can be found in <strong><code>phoenix_test/target/surefire-reports</code></strong>. If there are any failures, they would come with file names and line numbers.</p>
-   <p>The source code can be found in <strong><code>phoenix_test/src/test/java/com/trafodion/phoenix/end2end</code></strong>.</p> 
-   <p>These are JDBC tests written in java.</p>
-  </li>

-This page describes how to add or modify Trafodion tests and/or test suites. Please refer to the [Contribute](contribute.html) page for information about other ways to contribute to the Trafodion project.
-
-**Note**: The [Test](testing.html) page describes how the different Trafodion test libraries are organized and how you run different test. You should familiarize yourself with that page before modifying the Trafodion tests.
-
-# SQL Tests
-The SQL tests are located in: **```core/sql/regress```**. Please refer to the [Test](testing.html) page for information about each directory. Below, each of these directories is referred to as **```$scriptdir```**.
-
-The default output from **```core/sql/regress/tools/runallsb```** is located in **```$MY_SQROOT/rundir```**. This directory is referred to as **```$rundir```** below.
-
-Files associated with individual tests use the following naming convention: **```\<Type\>\<number\>```**. The files are organized as follows:
-
-Type       | Usage                              | Location
------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------
-TEST       | The test itself.                   | **```$scriptdir/<test suite>```** 
-EXPECTED   | The expected output from the test. | **```$scriptdir/<test suite>```**
-FILTER     | Filters out variable results (for example, timestamps) from test results to ensure consistent runs. | **```$scriptdir/<test suite>```**
-LOG        | The output from running the test.  | **```$rundir/<test suite>```**
-DIFF       | Diff between LOG and EXPECTED.     | **```$rundir/<test suite>```**
-
-## Modify a Test
-The comments in a test provides information of what it does. Make your changes and then do the following:
-
-* Run the test.
-* Verify that the LOG output is as desired.
-* Copy the LOG output to EXPECTED.
-* Rerun the test and verify that the test passes.
-
-### Output with Variable Data
-If there are time stamps or generated names that may vary from run to run or from user to user, then you need to create a ```FILTER\<test number\>``` file. This will filter out the variable portions of the test results so the test results are consistent.
- 
-Example filter file: **```core/sql/regress/core/FILTER024```**  
-
-**```core/sql/regress/tools```** contains generic filter files. These cover general/common variables in test output. You will need to add a new test specific filer if it’s specific to your new test output only. 
-
-### Check In Changes
-Check in the TEST and EXPECTED files in **```$scriptsdir```**.
-
-## Create New Test
-Creating a test is just a variation of [Modify a Test](#Modify_a_Test). The test should be associated with a test suite that covers the component you want to test. Please contact the [Trafodion Developer List](mail-lists.html) if you need help chosing the correct test suite.
-
-Once you've chosen the test suite and, therefore, the test source directory, you do the following:
-
-* Add the new test file to the test file in the selected test-suite directory.
-    * Use the naming convention found in the directory. (Normally: **```TEST\<nnn\>```**)
-    * Refer to **```core/sql/regress/runregr_\<test suite\>.ksh```** to verify the naming convention used.
-* The test DDL should use the schema name associated with the test suite.
-    * Refer to other test suites for examples.
-* Test and validate as described in [Modify a Test](#Modify_a_Test) above. 
-
-## Create New Test Suite
-The test suites cover different SQL components. Most components should be covered with the existing test suites.
-
-Do the following to create a new test suite:
-
-* Create a new directory with the suite name under **```core/sql/regress```**; for example: **```\<new test suite\>```**.
-* Refer to [Create New Test](#Create_New_Test) for instructions on how to add tests to the new test suite.
-* Add a test driver in **```core/sql/regress/tools```** directory with name **```runregr_\<new test suite\>.ksh```**. (Just copy and modify one of the other test drivers.)
-* Add the new test suite to **```core/sql/regress/runallsb/TEST_SUBDIRS```**.

-This page describes how to change the Trafodion web pages. Please refer to the [Contribute](contribute.html) page for information about other ways to contribute to the Trafodion project.
-
-#Organization
-
-**Source**: **```docs/src```** in the Trafodion source tree.
-
-**Publication:** https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-trafodion-site.git
-
-You develop and test all changes in the Trafodion source tree. Once checked in and built, the content of ```docs/target``` plus different [documentation](document.html) are copied to https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-trafodion-site.git. The changes are then pushed out by Apache gitpubsub, thereby populating http://incubator.trafodion.apache.org.
-
-# Making Changes
-The following information helps you understand how to make changes to the web-site content.
-
-----
-
-## Technology
-
-The Trafodion website uses the following technologies:
-
-* **Framework**: [Apache Maven Site](https://maven.apache.org)
-* **Skin**: [Reflow Maven Skin](http://andriusvelykis.github.io/reflow-maven-skin/) 
-* **Theme**: [Bootswatch Cerulean](http://bootswatch.com/cerulean)
-* **Markdown**: [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) 
-
-<a href="#" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs">Note</a> **```markdown```** was chosen since it supports inline HTML, which provides better table control than APT. Asciidoc does not work well with the Reflow Maven Skin — we tested.
-
-**Note**: Markdown supports basic tables only; that is, you'll need to use ```<table>``` HTML definitions for formatted tables such as cells with bullet lists.
-
-## Code Organization
-
-The code is located in the **```docs```** directory. The code organization follows the [Maven standard](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-site.html).
-
-**```docs/src/site.xml```** is configured per the [Reflow Maven Skin documentation](http://andriusvelykis.github.io/reflow-maven-skin/skin/). Pages and menus are defined and configured in this file. By default, all pages use an automated table of contents; override as needed.
-
-**```docs/src/site/markdown```** contains the files that generate the different HTML files.
-
-**```docs/target```** contains the generated HTML files after you run a build.
-
-## Managing Pages
-
-You add/rename/delete pages in **```docs/src/site/markdown```**. You make corresponding changes in **```docs/src/site.xml```** adding/renaming/deleting pages from menus and defining page configuration; for example: removal of the table of contents bar and the special page formatting provided by the Reflow skin. Refer to the [Maven Documentation](http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/examples/sitedescriptor.html) for more information.
-
-## Providing Content
-
-When possible, ensure that you write in active voice and to the point. 
-
-Special functions such as buttons etc. can be access by clicking **Preview** in the theme preview. There's a \<\> feature on each function, which allows you to copy the special **```\<div\>```** you need to insert the selected object.
-
-## Development Environment
-
-Typically, you'll use Eclipse to develop and build the website pages. The configuration goal is: **```clean site```**. The **```pom.xml```** file in the top-level directory drives the build steps for the web site.
-
-## Testing Changes
-
-The website files are located in **```docs/target```**. Open **```index.html```** from your browser and test your changes. For example, you want to validate the page layout, page navigation, links, and review the overall content on the pages you modified or added/deleted.
-
-## Tables
-markdown supports a simple format for tables. You can use markdown-style writing in such tables.
-
-    Table Header   | Table Header
-    ---------------|---------------
-    Text           | Text
-    Text           | Text
-
-However, no special formatting can be done; for example, creating a bulleted list in a cell. If you need tables with such formatting, then you will need to define the table in raw HTML format. No markdown-style writing is supported for HTML tables; use pure HTML tagging instead.
-
-## Callout Boxes
-You can create a simple callout box using an HTML table. Example:
-
-    <table><tr><td><strong>NOTE</strong><br />Whatever you want to say here.</td></tr></table>
-
-Generates:
-
-<table><tr><td><strong>NOTE</strong><br />Whatever you want to say here.</td></tr></table>
-
-----
-
-# Publishing
-
-<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
-  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert">&close;</button>
-  <p style="color:black">Publication is done when a committer is ready to update the external web site. You do <strong>not</strong> perform these steps as part of checking in changes.</p></div>
-
-Do the following:
-
-1. Fetch changes to be published from the Trafodion master branch.
-2. Build Trafodion site (source ./env.sh; mvn post-site).
-3. If there are documentation changes to prior releases, check out those release branch(es) and re-build the affected docs (mvn post-site).
-4. ```git clone``` https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-trafodion-site.git
-5. Copy content of ```docs/target``` into the incubator-trafodion-site directory. Commit changes.
-6. Push them back to the apache origin repo to the ```asf-site``` branch.
-
-Once pushed, Apache gitpubsub takes care of populating http://incubator.trafodion.apache.org with your new changes.
-If they don't show up, pushing another empty (or whitespace change) commit may work to trigger the automation.

-This page describes how to change the Trafodion Wiki. Please refer to the [Contribute](contribute.html) page for information about other ways to contribute to the Trafodion project.
-
-# Getting Access
-
-We use a "white-listing" permissions scheme for editing the Wiki. We do this to prevent anonymous spammers from spamming the site.
-
-If you'd like to contribute to the wiki, just obtain a Confluence user ID on the Apache wiki, then send an e-mail to the dev@incubator.trafodion.org dlist requesting access (and providing your Confluence user ID name). 
-
-A friendly administrator will then grant you editing privileges.
