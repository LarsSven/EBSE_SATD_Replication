-      distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
-      under the terms of the version of the License under which You
-      originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
-      Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting
-      it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any
-      subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make
-      the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
-      the License under which You originally received the Covered
-      Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
-      otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
-      any subsequent version of the License published by the license
-      steward.

-   IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
-   SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
-   PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
-   PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED
-   SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
-   DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
-   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
-   WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
-   ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
-   DISCLAIMER.
-
-6. TERMINATION.
-
-      6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
-      terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein
-      and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of
-      the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
-      effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
-
-      6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
-      declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
-      Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
-      You assert such claim is referred to as .Participant.) alleging
-      that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version
-      where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software
-      where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
-      indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted
-      directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
-      Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and
-      all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
-      shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
-      prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day
-      notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw
-      Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such
-      Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written
-      agreement with Participant.
-
-      6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
-      above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by

+    of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
+    copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
+    or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
+    Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
+    Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
+    through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
+
+    3.2. Modifications.
+
+    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
+    governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You

+
+    3.3. Required Notices.
+
+    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
+    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not

+    Initial Developer.
+
+    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
+
+    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in

+    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
+    liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
+    However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
+    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
+    absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
+    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
+    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
+    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
+    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
+
+    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
+
+    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
+    the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
+    choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
+    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
+    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
+    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
+    the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
+    Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
+    it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
+    are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
+    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
+    every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
+    Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
+
+    3.6. Larger Works.
+
+    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
+    other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
+    the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
+    sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
+    Software.
+
+4. Versions of the License.
+
+    4.1. New Versions.
+
+    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
+    new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
+    given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
+    4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
+    this License.
+
+    4.2. Effect of New Versions.
+
+    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
+    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
+    License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
+    the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
+    prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
+    under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
+    make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
+    of the License under which You originally received the Covered
+    Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
+    otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
+    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
+
+    4.3. Modified Versions.
+
+    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
+    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
+    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
+    remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
+    note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
+    make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
+    License.
+
+5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
+
+    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
+    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
+    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
+    IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
+    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
+    THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
+    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
+    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
+    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
+    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
+    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
+
+6. TERMINATION.
+
+    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
+    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
+    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
+    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
+    termination of this License shall survive.
+
+    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
+    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
+    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
+    assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
+    Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
+    Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
+    Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
+    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
+    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
+    Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
+    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
+    from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
+    expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
+    day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
+    Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
+    a written agreement with Participant.
+
+    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
+    alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
+    infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
+    license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
+    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
+    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
+    into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
+    license.
+
+    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
+    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
+    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
+    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
+
+7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
+
+    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
+    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
+    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
+    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
+    TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
+    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
+    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
+    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
+    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
+    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
+    APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
+    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
+    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
+    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
+    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
+
+8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
+
+    The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
+    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
+    software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §
+    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"
+    as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
+    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
+    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
+    with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
+    clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
+    clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
+    software under this License.
+
+9. MISCELLANEOUS.
+
+    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
+    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
+    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
+    the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
+    the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
+    provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
+    provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
+    to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
+    venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
+    with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
+    limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
+    The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
+    the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
+    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
+    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
+    agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
+    States export administration regulations (and the export control
+    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
+    or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
+
+10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
+
+    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
+    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
+    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
+    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
+    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
+    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

+  The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991
+
+Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
+51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor
+Boston, MA 02110-1335
+USA
+
+Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
+of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
+
+Preamble
+
+The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
+share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
+intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
+make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
+License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
+to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
+Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
+Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
+
+When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
+Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
+freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
+service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
+want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
+free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
+
+To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
+to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
+restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
+distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
+
+For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
+or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
+You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
+And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
+
+We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
+(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
+distribute and/or modify the software.
+
+Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
+that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
+software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
+want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
+that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
+authors' reputations.
+
+Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
+We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
+individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
+proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
+be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
+
+The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
+modification follow.
+
+TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
+
+0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
+notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
+the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
+to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
+either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
+to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
+verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
+(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
+"modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
+
+Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
+covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
+the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
+covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
+(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
+is true depends on what the Program does.
+
+1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
+code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
+and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
+and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
+this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
+recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
+
+You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
+you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
+
+2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
+it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
+such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
+that you also meet all of these conditions:
+
+    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
+    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
+
+    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
+    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
+    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
+    under the terms of this License.
+
+    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
+    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
+    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
+    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
+    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
+    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
+    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
+    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
+    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
+    is not required to print an announcement.)
+
+These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
+identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
+can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
+themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
+sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
+distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
+the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
+License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
+whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
+
+Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
+your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
+exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
+collective works based on the Program.
+
+In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
+with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
+storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
+scope of this License.
+
+3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
+under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
+Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
+
+    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
+    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
+    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
+    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
+    of physically performing source distribution, a complete
+    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
+    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
+    customarily used for software interchange; or,
+
+    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
+    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
+    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
+    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
+    accord with Subsection b above.)
+
+The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
+making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
+means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
+associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
+compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
+exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
+normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
+components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
+which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
+executable.
+
+If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
+to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
+the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
+code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
+along with the object code.
+
+4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
+except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
+to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
+automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
+who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
+not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
+full compliance.
+
+5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
+signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
+distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
+prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
+modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
+its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
+Program or works based on it.
+
+6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
+Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
+original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
+these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
+on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
+responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
+
+7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
+infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
+conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
+otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
+excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
+so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
+any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
+distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
+not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
+receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
+could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
+distribution of the Program.
+
+If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
+any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
+apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
+circumstances.
+
+It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
+patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
+such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
+integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
+by public license practices. Many people have made generous
+contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
+system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
+the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
+software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
+
+This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
+a consequence of the rest of this License.
+
+8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
+certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
+original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
+add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
+countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
+not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
+limitation as if written in the body of this License.
+
+9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
+versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
+versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
+differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
+
+Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
+specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
+later version", you have the option of following the terms and
+conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
+the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
+number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
+Free Software Foundation.
+
+10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
+programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
+author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
+Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
+sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
+two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
+software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
+
+NO WARRANTY
+
+11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
+WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
+EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
+OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
+EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
+WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
+ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
+YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
+NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
+
+12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
+WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
+AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
+DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
+DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
+(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
+INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
+THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
+OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
+
+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
+
+How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
+
+If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
+
+To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
+attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
+the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
+"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
+
+    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
+    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
+
+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
+    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
+    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
+    (at your option) any later version.
+
+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
+    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU
+    General Public License for more details.
+
+    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
+    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
+    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA
+
+Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
+
+If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
+when it starts in an interactive mode:
+
+    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
+    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type
+    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute
+    it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
+
+The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
+appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands
+you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they
+could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
+
+You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
+school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
+necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
+
+    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
+    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by
+    James Hacker.

+    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

+
+This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
+into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
+may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
+with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
+General Public License instead of this License.
+
+#
+
+Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its
+affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special
+exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its
+Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only
+where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's
+header the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to
+the "Classpath" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file
+that accompanied this code."
+
+You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent
+programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided
+under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software
+Foundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs
+licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are
+licensed to you under their original licenses.
+
+Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding
+the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which
+permits you to use that code in combination with other independent
+modules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would
+not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with
+Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such
+code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then
+distributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the
+Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and
+distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or
+all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and
+since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items
+included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath
+Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to
+further distribute the package.
+
+Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a
+lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath
+Exception or making modifications to this package which may
+subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party
+software.
+
+CLASSPATH EXCEPTION
+Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is
+making a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and
+conditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole
+combination.
+
+As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
+permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
+executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent
+modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under
+terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked
+independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that

+title: Third party dependencies and licensing
+---
+
+The bookkeeper project ships one source distribution and two binary distributions.
+
+- ```bookkeeper-<version>-src.tar.gz```, which contains the source code to build bookkeeper.
+- ```bookkeeper-all-<version>-bin.tar.gz```, which contains the bookkeeper server and all optional dependencies.
+- ```bookkeeper-server-<version>-bin.tar.gz```, which contains the bare minimum to run a bookkeeper server.
+
+The source distribution can contain source code copied from third parties. The binaries ship with third party dependencies in jar file form. 
+
+As the ASF may not own the copyright on the contents of this copied source code or third party jars, we may need to account for them in the LICENSE and/or NOTICE file of the distribution.
+
+The LICENSE and NOTICE files for the source distribution are found at:
+- [bookkeeper/LICENSE](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/LICENSE)
+- [bookkeeper/NOTICE](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/NOTICE)
+
+The LICENSE and NOTICE files for the binary distribution are found at:
+- [bookkeeper/bookkeeper-dist/src/main/resources/LICENSE-all.bin.txt (for -all package)](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-dist/src/main/resources/LICENSE-all.bin.txt)
+- [bookkeeper/bookkeeper-dist/src/main/resources/NOTICE-all.bin.txt (for -all package)](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-dist/src/main/resources/NOTICE-all.bin.txt)

+
+When updating these files, use the following rules of thumb:
+- BSD/MIT-style dependencies should be covered in LICENSE.
+- Apache Software License dependences should be covered in NOTICE, but only if they themselves contain a NOTICE file.
+- NOTICE should be kept to a minimum, and only contain what is legally required.
+- The LICENSE and NOTICE files for the binary packages should contains everything in source LICENSE and NOTICE packages, unless the source code being referred to does not ship in the binary packages (for example, if it was copied in only for tests).
+- All shipped dependencies should be mentioned in LICENSE for completeness, along with a link to their source code if available.
+- Any license other than BSD/MIT-style or ASL should be discussed on [the dev list](/community/mailing-lists).
+- If you have any doubts, raise them on [the dev list](/community/mailing-lists).
+
+# Handling new/updated source dependencies
+
+For bookkeeper, a source dependency is any code which has been copied in code form into our source tree. An example of this is [circe-checksum](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/tree/master/circe-checksum) which was copied into our codebase and modified. Depending on the license of source code, you may need to update the source distribution LICENSE and NOTICE files.
+
+In the case of circe-checksum, the original code is under the Apache Software License, Version 2 (ASLv2), and there is no NOTICE file, so neither LICENSE nor NOTICE need to be updated.
+
+If, for example, we were to copy code from [Hadoop](https://github.com/apache/hadoop), and the code in question was originally written for Hadoop, then we would not need to update LICENSE or NOTICE, as Hadoop is also licensed under the ASLv2, and while it has a NOTICE file, the part covering code originally written for Hadoop is covered by the line, "This product includes software developed by The Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).", which already exists in our NOTICE. However, if we were to copy code from Hadoop that originally originated elsewhere, such as their [pure java CRC library](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/f67237cbe7bc48a1b9088e990800b37529f1db2a/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/PureJavaCrc32C.java), this code is originally from Intel, under a BSD style license, so you would have to track down the original license, add it to [deps/](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-dist/src/main/resources/) and link it from our LICENSE file.
+
+If we were to copy code from [Netty](https://github.com/netty/netty/), and the code in question was originally written for Netty, then we would need to update NOTICE with the relevant portions (i.e. the first section) from the [Netty NOTICE file](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/4.1/NOTICE.txt), as Netty is licensed under the ASLv2 and it _does_ contain a NOTICE file. If we were to copy code from Netty which originally originated elsewhere, but had also been modified by Netty, for example [their SLF4J modifications](https://github.com/netty/netty/blob/b60e0b6a51d59fb9a98918c8783265b30531de57/common/src/main/java/io/netty/logging/CommonsLogger.java), we would need to update our NOTICE with the relevant portions (i.e. the first section) from Netty's NOTICE, and also add the SLF4J license to [deps/](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-dist/src/main/resources/) and link it from our LICENSE file (as it has an MIT-style license).
+
+If we were to copy code from [Protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) or [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/) into our code base, then we would have to copy their license to [deps/](https://github.com/apache/bookkeeper/blob/master/bookkeeper-dist/src/main/resources/) and link it from our LICENSE file, as these projects are under [BSD-style](https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/LICENSE) and [MIT-style](https://www.slf4j.org/license.html) licenses respectively.
+
+# Handling new/updated binary dependencies
+
+When a new binary dependency is added, or a dependency version is updated, we need to update the LICENSE and NOTICE files for our binary packages. There is a separate version of each of these files for both the -all tarball and the -server tarball. The files can be found at ```bookkeeper-dist/src/main/resources```.
+
+How you update the files depends on the licensing of the dependency. Most dependencies come under either the Apache Software License, Version 2, or an MIT/BSD style license. If the software comes under anything else, it's best to ask for advice on the [dev@ list](/community/mailing-lists).
+
+## dev/check-binary-license script
+
+We provide a script which will check if the LICENSE file attached to a binary tarball matches the jar files distributed in that tarball. The goal of the script is to ensure that all shipped binaries are accounted for, and that nothing else is mentioned in the LICENSE or NOTICE files.
+
+To check that licensing is correct, generate the tarball and run the script against it as follows (in this example I've removed references to protobuf from the LICENSE file).
+
+```shell
+~/src/bookkeeper $ mvn clean package -DskipTests
+...
+
+~/src/bookkeeper $ dev/check-binary-license bookkeeper-dist/server/target/bookkeeper-server-4.7.0-SNAPSHOT-bin.tar.gz
+com.google.protobuf-protobuf-java-3.4.0.jar unaccounted for in LICENSE
+deps/protobuf-3.4.0/LICENSE bundled, but not linked from LICENSE
+
+~/src/bookkeeper $ 
+```
+
+The script checks the following:
+1. If a jar file is included in the tarball, this file must be mentioned in the LICENSE file.
+2. If a jar file is mentioned in LICENSE or NOTICE, then this jar file must exist in the tarball.
+3. If a license exists under deps/ in the tarball, this is license must be linked in the LICENSE file.
+3. If a license is linked from the LICENSE file, it must exist under deps/ in the tarball.
+
+This script will fail the check even if only the version of the dependency has changed. This is intentional. The licensing requirements of a dependency can change between versions, so if a dependency version changes, we should check that the entries for that dependency are correct in our LICENSE and NOTICE files.
+
+## Apache Software License, Version 2 binary dependencies
+
+1. Add the jar under "The following bundled 3rd party jars are distributed under the Apache Software License, Version 2."
+2. Add a link to the source code of this dependency if available. This will help anyone updating the license in the future.
+3. Check the LICENSE file of the dependency.
+  - If it only contains the Apache Software License, Version 2, nothing needs to be copied into our LICENSE file.
+  - If there is something other than the ASLv2, then you must figure out if it refers to code that is actually shipped in the jar. If it is shipped in the jar, then check the license of that code and apply the rules to it as you would if it was a first order dependency.
+4. Check the NOTICE file of the dependency, if there is one.
+  - Copy any copyright notices to our NOTICE, unless they are for Apache Software Foundation (already covered by our own copyright notice), or they are refer to code covered by a BSD/MIT style license (some projects mistakenly put these in the NOTICE file, but these should be noted in the _LICENSE_ file).
+  - Ensure that anything copies from the NOTICE file refers to code which is actually shipped with our tarball. Some projects put optional dependencies in their NOTICE, which are not actually pulled into our distribution, so we should not include these.
+
+## BSD/MIT style license binary dependencies
+
+1. Add a section to the LICENSE file, stating that "This product bundles X, which is available under X".
+2. Add the license to ```bookkeeper-dist/src/main/resources/deps/``` and add a link to this file from the LICENSE file.
+3. Ensure that the deps/ license is in the inclusion lists for the correct package assembly specs (```bookkeeper-dist/src/assemble/```).
+4. The section must state the path of the jar that is covered by the license, so that the tool can pick it up.
+5. Add a link to the source code of the dependency if available, to make it easier to update the dependency in future.
+6. Sometimes the LICENSE of a dependency refers to a dependency which they themselves has bundled. These references should be copied to our LICENSE file, as if they were first order dependencies.
